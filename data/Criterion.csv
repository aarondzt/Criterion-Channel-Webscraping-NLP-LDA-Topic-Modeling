2 or 3 Things I Know About Her,Jean-Luc Godard,France,1967,1.45,"In 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER (2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D’ELLE), Jean-Luc Godard beckons us ever closer, whispering in our ears as narrator. About what? Money, sex, fashion, the city, love, language, war: in a word, everything. Among the legendary French filmmaker’s finest achievements, the film takes as its ostensible subject the daily life of Juliette Janson (Marina Vlady), a housewife from the Paris suburbs who prostitutes herself for extra money. Yet this is only a template for Godard to spin off into provocative philosophical tangents and gorgeous images. 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER is perhaps Godard’s most revelatory look at consumer culture, shot in ravishing widescreen color by Raoul Coutard.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/2-or-3-things-i-know-about-her
3 Faces,Jafar Panahi,Iran,2018,1.67,"Iranian master Jafar Panahi’s fourth feature since he was officially banned from filmmaking is a courageous act of antipatriarchal defiance from an artist who has refused to be silenced. This playful docufiction road movie begins with a smartphone video sent to the director and real-life star actress Behnaz Jafari from a desperate young woman who, distraught at her family’s refusal to let her study drama, seemingly records her own suicide. Traveling to the woman’s rural hometown to investigate, Panahi and Jafari find themselves launched on a slyly comic, quietly revelatory journey that builds in narrative, thematic, and visual intricacy to put forth a grand expression of community and solidarity under the eye of oppression.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/3-faces
"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",Cristian Mungiu,Romania,2007,1.88,"Romanian filmmaker Cristian Mungiu shot to international prominence with this rigorously realistic Palme d’Or–winning second feature. In 1987, during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu, college roommates Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) and Găbița (Laura Vasiliu) seek an illegal abortion for Găbița. In unflinching but empathetic detail, the film recounts the events of twenty-four perilous hours in their lives, culminating in their encounter with a manipulative and menacing abortionist (Vlad Ivanov). With powerful performances that accentuate the characters’ flawed humanity, 4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS is a gutting account of the impossible choices women face when taking control of their bodies means breaking the law.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days
"The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T",Roy Rowland,United States,1953,1.47,"One of the most outrageous acts of cinematic surrealism ever to emanate from Hollywood’s dream factory, the only film written by Theodor Seuss Geisel (a.k.a. Dr. Seuss) is a riotous Technicolor fantasy in which a young boy (Tommy Rettig) dreams himself into an imaginary world ruled by a diabolical piano teacher (Hans Conried) who forces five hundred children to practice an enormous keyboard for eternity. With its outlandish sets, eccentric musical numbers (with lyrics also penned by Dr. Seuss), and vaguely unsettling tone, THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T. was met with incomprehension upon its release but has since taken its place as a beloved cult favorite, a one-of-a-kind children’s film that doubles as a triumph of genuine avant-garde imagination.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-5-000-fingers-of-dr-t
5x2,François Ozon,France,2004,1.5,"François Ozon tracks five key episodes in a couple’s disintegrating marriage—beginning with the end of the affair. Starting with their divorce and moving backwards toward their first meeting, 5X2 examines the milestones—from intimations of infidelity to the birth of their son to their wedding day—that sound the death knell of the relationship between ordinary middle-class couple Gilles (Stéphane Freiss) and Marion (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi). Working in a style at once coolly detached and painfully intimate, Ozon offers penetrating insight into the moments, both big and small, that make—and break—a marriage.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/5x2
"The VI Olympic Winter Games, Oslo 1952",Tankred Ibsen,Norway,1952,1.72,"Director Tancred Ibsen's penchant for depicting rustic life shines through in the bucolic scenes at the start of THE VI OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES, OSLO 1952. In addition to the exciting scenes of competition (Winter sports are followed with almost rabid fervor in Scandinavia), Ibsen records a sense of community spirit shared among the competitors.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-vi-olympic-winter-games-oslo-1952
8½,Federico Fellini,Italy,1963,2.32,"Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, a director whose new project is collapsing around him, along with his life. One of the greatest films about film ever made, Federico Fellini’s 8½ (Otto e mezzo) turns one man’s artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema. An early working title for 8½ was THE BEAUTIFUL CONFUSION, and Fellini’s masterpiece is exactly that: a shimmering dream, a circus, and a magic act.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/81-2
The IX Olympiad at Amsterdam,,Netherlands,1928,4.18,"Made by Istituto Luce, the Italian film company controlled by Benito Mussolini since 1925, THE IX OLYMPIAD IN AMSTERDAM may, understandably, highlight Italian participants, but it is the first Olympic documentary that describes the techniques of certain events with useful particulars.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-ix-olympiad-in-amsterdam
"IX Olympic Winter Games, Innsbruck 1964",Theo Hörmann,Austria,1964,1.5,"Joy and good humor pervades Theo Hörmann's documentary record of the 1964 Games in Austria.

12 O’Clock Boys,Lotfy Nathan,United States,2013,1.25,"Meet the 12 O’Clock Boys, an infamous urban dirt-bike pack who whiz through the streets of Baltimore. Popping wheelies and weaving at excessive speeds through traffic, the group impressively evades the hamstrung police. Three years in the making, Lotfy Nathan’s wild, dynamic documentary captures their death-defying antics through the eyes of young adolescent Pug, a bright kid from the Westside obsessed with the riders and willing to do anything to join their ranks. Propelled by breathtakingly kinetic footage that takes viewers along for the ride, 12 O’CLOCK BOYS spins a compelling, intimate story of a young boy and his dangerous, thrilling dream.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/12-o-clock-boys
13 Days in France,François Reichenbach…,France,1968,1.87,"13 DAYS IN FRANCE, a personal project for French filmmaker Claude Lelouch, approaches the X Olympic Winter Games in a radical way, ignoring certain disciplines and dwelling on others. This impressionistic kaleidoscope of a movie manages to be both freewheeling and intimate. Under the direction of Lelouch and François Reichenbach, 13 DAYS IN FRANCE pulses with the insouciant spirit of the sixties and the carefree cinematography and editing pioneered by the French New Wave.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/13-days-in-france
XIVth Olympiad: The Glory of Sport,Castleton Knight,United Kingdom,1948,2.3,"The official film of the Games of the XIV Olympiad London 1948 is the first in color and seeks to comprise both the winter and summer events from that year.

16 Days of Glory,Bud Greenspan,United States,1986,4.73,"Director Bud Greenspan, whose career covering sporting events had begun some twenty years earlier, seized the opportunity to helm the official film of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics with such gusto that he would become the IOC's go-to person for Olympic movies. And this 284-minute record of the 1984 Games set the tone for his nine Olympic films to come. 16 DAYS OF GLORY is audacious and fresh and springs from a fascination with the energy and ambition that drive the finest athletes.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/16-days-of-glory

24 Frames,Abbas Kiarostami,Iran,2017,1.88,"For what would prove to be his final film, Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami gave himself a challenge: to create a dialogue between his work as a filmmaker and his work as a photographer, bridging the two art forms to which he had dedicated his life. Setting out to reconstruct the moments immediately before and after a photograph is taken, Kiarostami selected twenty-four still images—most of them stark landscapes inhabited only by foraging birds and other wildlife—and digitally animated each one into its own subtly evolving four-and-a-half-minute vignette, creating a series of poignant studies in movement, perception, and time. A sustained meditation on the process of image making, 24 FRAMES is a graceful and elegiac farewell from one of the giants of world cinema.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/24-frames
The 39 Steps,Alfred Hitchcock,United Kingdom,1935,1.45,"A heart-racing spy story by Alfred Hitchcock, THE 39 STEPS follows Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) as he stumbles upon a conspiracy that thrusts him into a hectic chase across the Scottish moors—a chase in which he is both the pursuer and the pursued—as well as into an unexpected romance with the cool Pamela (Madeline Carroll). Adapted from a novel by John Buchan, this classic wrong-man thriller from the Master of Suspense anticipates the director’s most famous works (especially NORTH BY NORTHWEST), and remains one of his cleverest and most entertaining films.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-39-steps
45 Years,Andrew Haigh,United Kingdom,2015,1.58,"In this exquisitely calibrated film, Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay perform a subtly off-kilter pas de deux as Kate and Geoff, an English couple who, on the eve of an anniversary celebration, find their long marriage shaken by the arrival of a letter to Geoff that unceremoniously collapses his past into their shared present. Director Andrew Haigh carries the tradition of British realist cinema to artful new heights in 45 YEARS, weaving the momentous into the mundane as the pair go about their daily lives, while the evocatively flat, wintry Norfolk landscape frames their struggle to maintain an increasingly untenable status quo. Loosely adapting a short story by David Constantine, Haigh shifts the focus from the slightly erratic Geoff to Kate, eliciting a remarkable, nuanced portrayal by Rampling of a woman’s gradual metamorphosis from unflappable wife to woman undone.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/45-years

49th Parallel,Michael Powell,United Kingdom,1941,2.03,"At once a compelling piece of anti-isolationist propaganda and a quick-witted wartime thriller, 49TH PARALLEL is a classic early work from the inimitable British filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. When a Nazi U-boat crew, headed by the ruthless Eric Portman, is stranded in Canada during the thick of World War II, the men evade capture by hiding out in a series of rural communities, before trying to cross the border into the still-neutral United States. Both soul-stirring and delightfully entertaining, 49TH PARALLEL features a colorful cast of characters played by larger-than-life actors Laurence Olivier, Raymond Massey, Anton Walbrook, and Leslie Howard.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/49th-parallel
The 400 Blows,François Truffaut,France,1959,1.67,"François Truffaut’s first feature is also his most personal. Told through the eyes of Truffaut’s cinematic counterpart, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), THE 400 BLOWS sensitively re-creates the trials of Truffaut’s own childhood, unsentimentally portraying aloof parents, oppressive teachers, and petty crime. The film marked Truffaut’s passage from leading critic to trailblazing auteur of the French New Wave.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-400-blows

An Actor’s Revenge,Kon Ichikawa,Japan,1963,1.88,"A uniquely prolific and chameleonic figure of world cinema, Kon Ichikawa delivered a burst of stylistic bravado with this intricate tale of betrayal and retribution. Set in the cloistered world of nineteenth-century kabuki theater, the film charts a female impersonator’s attempts to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were driven to insanity and suicide by a trio of corrupt men. Ichikawa takes the conventions of melodrama and turns them on their head, bringing the hero’s fractured psyche to life in boldly experimental widescreen compositions infused with kaleidoscopic color, pop-art influences, and meticulous choreography. Anchored by a magnificently androgynous performance by Kazuo Hasegawa, reprising a role he had played on-screen three decades earlier, AN ACTOR’S REVENGE is an eye-popping examination of how the illusions of art intersect with life.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/an-actor-s-revenge
Actress,Robert Greene,United States,2014,1.47,"The societal roles women are expected to play and the challenges of balancing career and family are the central subjects of Robert Greene’s rich, endlessly fascinating documentary. Combining elements of melodrama and cinema verité, the film follows the travails of a former actress turned housewife as she prepares to make a comeback. Brandy Burre had a recurring role on HBO’s THE WIRE when she gave up her career to start a family. She left New York City to make a home with her boyfriend and their two children in Beacon, New York. When Brandy decides to reclaim her life as an actor, the domestic world she’s thoughtfully created crumbles around her. Toying provocatively with questions of artifice and authenticity, ACTRESS is a multifaceted portrait of a complicated woman, performing the role of herself, in a complex story about starring in the movie of one’s own life.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/actress
The Adjuster,Atom Egoyan,Canada,1991,1.7,"Noah Render (Elias Koteas) is an insurance claims adjuster who attends to his clients’ every need—including their sexual ones.

Adoration,Atom Egoyan,Canada,2008,1.68,"Atom Egoyan’s provocative twelfth feature continues his long-standing fascination with the relationship between technology and the construction of personal identity. Sabine (Arsinée Khanjian), a high school French teacher, gives her class a translation exercise based on a real news story about a terrorist who plants a bomb in the airline luggage of his pregnant girlfriend. The assignment has a profound effect on one student, Simon (Devon Bostick), who reimagines the news item as his own family’s story. When Simon uses the story as the basis to create a false online identity, it sets off a ripple effect of controversy and catharsis that reaches around the world.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/adoration

After the Rehearsal,Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1984,1.22,"With this spare chamber piece, set in an empty theater, Ingmar Bergman returned to his perennial theme of the permeability of life and art. Lingering after a rehearsal for August Strindberg’s “A Dream Play” (a touchstone for the filmmaker throughout his career), eminent director Henrik (Erland Josephson) enters into a frank and flirtatious conversation with his up-and-coming star, Anna (Lena Olin), leading him to recall his affair with Anna’s late mother, the self-destructive actress Rakel (Ingrid Thulin). The sharply written and impeccably performed AFTER THE REHEARSAL, originally made for television, pares away all artifice to examine both the allure and the cost of a life in the theater.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/after-the-rehearsal

¡Alambrista!,Robert M. Young,United States,1977,1.6,"In ¡ALAMBRISTA!, a Mexican farmworker sneaks across the border to California to make money to send to his family back home. It is a story that happens every day, told here in an uncompromising, groundbreaking work of realism from American independent filmmaker Robert M. Young. Vivid and spare where other films about illegal immigration might sentimentalize, Young’s take is equal parts intimate character study and gripping road movie, a political work that never loses sight of the complex man at its center. ¡ALAMBRISTA!, winner of the Cannes Film Festival’s inaugural Caméra d'Or in 1978, remains one of the best films ever made on this perennially relevant topic.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/alambrista
Alexander Nevsky,Sergei Eisenstein,Soviet Union,1938,1.8,"Eisenstein drew on history, Russian folk narratives, and the techniques of Walt Disney to create this broadly painted epic of Russian resilience. This story of Teutonic knights vanquished by Prince Alexander Nevsky’s tactical brilliance resonated deeply with a Soviet Union concerned with the rise of Nazi Germany. Widely imitated, most notably by Laurence Olivier’s Battle of Agincourt re-creation for HENRY V, the Battle on the Ice scene remains one of the most famous audio-visual experiments in film history, perfectly blending action with the rousing score of Sergei Prokofiev.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/alexander-nevsky
Alice,Jan Švankmajer,Czechoslovakia,1988,1.43,"Alice follows the White Rabbit into Wonderland, beginning a dream expedition into the astonishing landscape of childhood, through many dangerous adventures, and ultimately to a trial before the King and Queen of Hearts. Czech animation legend Jan Švankmajer blends live action and stunning stop motion to create a strikingly original interpretation of Lewis Carroll’s classic tale. Švankmajer’s ALICE remains true to the absurdity of Carroll’s vision, but bears the stamp of his own surrealist style and macabre obsessions, lending dark and fascinating new dimensions to a beloved fantasy.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/alice
Alice in the Cities,Wim Wenders,Germany,1974,1.88,"The first of the road films that would come to define the career of Wim Wenders, the magnificent ALICE IN THE CITIES is an emotionally generous and luminously shot odyssey. A German journalist (Rüdiger Vogler) is driving across the United States to research an article; it’s a disappointing trip, in which he is unable to truly connect with what he sees. Things change, however, when he has no choice but to take a young girl named Alice (Yella Rottländer) with him on his return trip to Germany, after her mother (Lisa Kreuzer)—whom he has just met—leaves the child in his care.

Ali: Fear Eats the Soul,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1974,1.55,"The wildly prolific German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder paid homage to his cinematic hero Douglas Sirk with this update of that filmmaker’s 1955 ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS. A lonely widow (Brigitte Mira) meets a much younger Arab worker (El Hedi ben Salem) in a bar during a rainstorm. They fall in love, to their own surprise—and to the outright shock of their families, colleagues, and drinking buddies. In ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL, Fassbinder expertly wields the emotional power of classic Hollywood melodrama to expose the racial tensions underlying contemporary German culture.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/ali-fear-eats-the-soul
All Monsters Attack,Ishiro Honda,Japan,1969,1.15,"Director Ishiro Honda returned again for the first Godzilla movie expressly for children. Economizing by reusing effects shots from other films in the series, All Monster Attack tells the story of Ichiro, a lonely latchkey kid who finds solace in his dreams of befriending Minilla, the titular progeny of Son of Godzilla, whose parent is also often absent. In this thoughtful, human-scale story, boy and monster learn together what it means to grow up.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/all-monsters-attack
All My Good Countrymen,Vojtech Jasný,Czechoslovakia,1969,2.0,"Vojtěch Jasný won the best director award at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for this sweeping portrait of a small Czech village between the years of 1945 and 1958, during which the residents go from hopeful in the aftermath of the defeat of the Nazis to increasingly demoralized in the face of the Communist takeover. Lyrical in its feeling for landscape but biting in its social and political commentary, ALL MY GOOD COUNTRYMEN stands as the defining work by one of the lesser-known figures of the Czechoslovak New Wave.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/all-my-good-countrymen

Adapted from the novel by Joseph Conrad, the sensuously atmospheric final narrative film by Chantal Akerman transposes the story from the late 1800s to the 1950s to create a trenchant critique of colonialism in its dying days wrapped in a saga of passion, loss, and madness.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/almayer-s-folly
Alps,Yorgos Lanthimos,Greece,2011,1.55,"Yorgos Lanthimos’s surreally funny follow-up to his international breakthrough DOGTOOTH is a mysterious and moving investigation into the process of mourning. An oddball group of four people (two hospital employees, a gymnast, and her coach) form a secret society that sets out to ease the grieving process for those whose loved ones have died. For a fee they will act the part of the missing family member, learning their hobbies and eccentricities in order to help the customer accept their loss. As methadone is to heroin addiction, so are the Alps, as they call themselves, to the mourning process. But when the nurse known as Monte Rosa (Angeliki Papoulia) begins to attach too deeply to her subjects, their project spirals out of control into violence and chaos.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/alps
Amarcord,Federico Fellini,Italy,1973,2.05,"This carnivalesque portrait of provincial Italy during the fascist period, the most personal film from Federico Fellini, satirizes the director’s youth and turns daily life into a circus of social rituals, adolescent desires, male fantasies, and political subterfuge, all set to Nina Rota’s classic, nostalgia-tinged score. The Academy Award winning AMARCORD remains one of cinema’s enduring treasures.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/amarcord
The American Friend,Wim Wenders,Germany,1977,2.12,"Wim Wenders pays loving homage to rough-and-tumble Hollywood film noir with THE AMERICAN FRIEND, a loose adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel “Ripley’s Game.” Dennis Hopper oozes quirky menace as an amoral American art dealer who entangles a terminally ill German everyman, played by Bruno Ganz, in a seedy criminal underworld as revenge for a personal slight, but when the two become embroiled in an ever-deepening murder plot, they form an unlikely bond. Filmed on location in Hamburg and Paris, with some scenes shot in grimy, late-seventies New York City, Wenders’ international breakout is a stripped-down crime story that mixes West German and American film flavors, and it features cameos by filmmakers Jean Eustache, Samuel Fuller, and Nicholas Ray.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-american-friend
The American Soldier,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1970,1.33,"The German-born American GI Ricky (Karl Scheydt) returns to Munich from Vietnam and is promptly hired as a contract killer. Rainer Werner Fassbinder's experimental noir is a subversive, self-reflexive gangster movie full of unexpected asides and stylistic flourishes, and features an audaciously bonkers final shot and memorable turns from many of the director's rotating gallery of players.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-american-soldier
Le amiche,Michelangelo Antonioni,Italy,1955,1.75,"This major early achievement by Michelangelo Antonioni bears the first signs of the cinema-changing style for which he would soon be world-famous. LE AMICHE (THE GIRLFRIENDS) is a brilliantly observed, fragmentary depiction of modern bourgeois life, conveyed from the perspective of five Turinese women. As four of the friends try to make sense of the suicide attempt of the fifth, they find themselves examining their own troubled romantic lives. With suggestions of the theme of modern alienation and the fastidious visual abstraction that would define his later masterpieces such as L’AVVENTURA, L’ECLISSE, and RED DESERT, Antonioni’s film is a devastating take on doomed love and fraught friendship.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/le-amiche
L’amore,Roberto Rossellini,Italy,1948,1.32,"Roberto Rosselini directs Anna Magnani in two short films about love and loneliness.

Andrei Rublev,Andrei Tarkovsky,Soviet Union,1966,3.05,"Tracing the life of a renowned icon painter, the second feature by Andrei Tarkovsky vividly conjures the murky world of medieval Russia. This dreamlike and remarkably tactile film follows Andrei Rublev as he passes through a series of poetically linked scenes—snow falls inside an unfinished church, naked pagans stream through a thicket during a torchlit ritual, a boy oversees the clearing away of muddy earth for the forging of a gigantic bell—gradually emerging as a man struggling mightily to preserve his creative and religious integrity. Appearing here in the director’s preferred 183-minute cut as well as the version that was originally suppressed by Soviet authorities, the masterwork ANDREI RUBLEV is one of Tarkovsky’s most revered films, an arresting meditation on art, faith, and endurance.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/andrei-rublev
Androcles and the Lion,Chester Erskine,United Kingdom,1952,1.63,"George Bernard Shaw's breezy, delightful dramatization of this classic fable, about a Christian slave who pulls a thorn from a lion's paw and is spared from death in the Colosseum as a result of his kind act, was written as a meditation on modern Christian values. And Pascal's final Shaw production plays it broadly, casting comic character actor Alan Young as the titular naïf. He's ably supported by Jean Simmons, Victor Mature, Robert Newton, and Elsa Lanchester.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/androcles-and-the-lion

And the Pursuit of Happiness,Louis Malle,France,1986,1.35,"In 1986, Louis Malle, himself a transplant to the United States, set out to investigate the ever-widening range of immigrant experience in America.

"And When I Die, I Won’t Stay Dead",Billy Woodberry,United States,2015,1.48,"Legendary Beat visionary Bob Kaufman considered poetry a key to human survival, an idea made all the more legitimate by the longevity it is granted: the things he saw, heard, tasted, felt, and, most of all, thought were preserved in his work. Embodying the spirit of those efforts, director Billy Woodberry’s first feature since his 1983 LA Rebellion landmark BLESS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS is perhaps the closest we can come to knowing the man and his time. Both dense and nimble in its assemblage of archival footage and photos, interviews with contemporaries, and readings from the likes of Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, AND WHEN I DIE looks back at a familiar era with new eyes, thanks in no small part to the honest assessment provided by many figures of New York’s Beat generation some half-century removed.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/and-when-i-die-i-won-t-stay-dead

Antichrist,Lars von Trier,Denmark,2009,1.8,"Lars von Trier shook up the film world when he premiered ANTICHRIST at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.

But this most confrontational work yet from one of contemporary cinema’s most controversial artists is no mere provocation. It is a visually sublime, emotionally ravaging journey to the darkest corners of the possessed human mind; a disturbing battle of the sexes that pits rational psychology against age-old superstition; and a profoundly effective horror film.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/antichrist

Before the Rain,Milcho Manchevski,Macedonia,1994,1.88,"The first film made in the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, Milcho Manchevski’s BEFORE THE RAIN crosscuts the stories of an orthodox Christian monk (Grégoire Colin), a British photo agent (Katrin Cartlidge), and a native Macedonian war photographer (Rade Šerbedžija) to paint a portrait of simmering ethnic and religious hatred about to reach its boiling point. Made during the strife of the war-torn Balkan states in the nineties, this gripping triptych of love and violence is also a timeless evocation of the loss of pastoral innocence, and remains one of recent cinema’s most powerful laments on the futility of war.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/before-the-rain

This surreal and erotic late-sixties daydream from provocateur for the ages Luis Buñuel is an examination of desire and fetishistic pleasure (its characters’ and its viewers’), as well as a gently absurdist take on contemporary social mores and class divisions.

At the offices of a Boston independent newspaper, the staff members—including music critic Max (Jeff Goldblum, in one of his first leading roles), news reporter Harry (John Heard) and photographer Abbie (Lindsay Crouse)—enjoy a positive and open-minded work environment.

But Voichita proves unwilling to abandon her calling, and Alina becomes increasingly desperate to reclaim her devotion, putting the outsider at odds with the monastery's ascetic priest, and precipitating a painfully misguided, brutal attempt to save her soul.

Bisbee ’17,Robert Greene,United States,2018,1.87,"Radically combining collaborative documentary, western, and musical elements, BISBEE ’17 follows several members of a close-knit community as they attempt to reckon with their town’s darkest hour. In 1917, nearly two thousand immigrant miners, on strike for better wages and safer working conditions, were violently rounded up by their armed neighbors, herded onto cattle cars, shipped to the middle of the New Mexican desert, and left there to die. This long-buried and largely forgotten event came to be known as the Bisbee Deportation. BISBEE ’17 documents locals as they reenact scenes from the controversial story, culminating in a large-scale re-creation of the deportation itself on the exact day of its 100th anniversary.

One of the first and best-loved films of this period in his career is THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT, which balances a realistic depiction of tormented romance with staging that remains true to the director’s roots in experimental theater. This unforgettable, unforgiving dissection of the imbalanced relationship between a haughty fashion designer (Margit Carstensen) and a beautiful but icy ingenue (Hanna Schygulla)—based, in a sly gender reversal, on the writer-director’s own desperate obsession with a young actor—is a true Fassbinder affair, featuring exquisitely claustrophobic cinematography by Michael Ballhaus and full-throttle performances by an all-female cast.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-bitter-tears-of-petra-von-kant

BLESS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS distills the social concerns and neorealist aesthetics of the movement into a sensitive exploration of the inner workings of community and family that pays homage to the power of the blues.

The Challenge,Milton Rosmer…,United Kingdom,1938,1.23,"Two explorers lead rival assaults in 1865 on the previously unconquered Matterhorn, resulting in triumph, tragedy, and a quest for redemption. The direction of mountaineer-turned-filmmaker (and actor) Luis Trenker, coupled with a screenplay co-authored by Emeric Pressberger (The Red Shoes) gave this fact-based film a harrowing visual and emotional realism that's still striking seven decades later.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-challenge
Chantal Akerman by Chantal Akerman,Chantal Akerman,France,1997,1.1,"Produced for French television’s CINEASTES DE NOTRE TEMPS series, this revealing self-portrait from Chantal Akerman unfolds in two parts. First, Akerman, in her apartment, offers a deeply personal, sometimes funny, always thoughtful account of the problems she encountered making her films. Part two lets Akerman’s films speak for her, weaving together clips from her extensive filmography and linking them until they form a new film. The result is a radically original work that redefines the form of the artist documentary.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/chantal-akerman-by-chantal-akerman
The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith,Fred Schepisi,Australia,1978,1.95,"One of the most powerful films to address Australia’s history of racism and exploitation of its Indigenous people, Fred Schepisi’s acclaimed adaptation of the novel by Thomas Keneally follows the downward spiral of its title character (Tommy Lewis), a half-Aboriginal, half-white young man whose mistreatment at the hands of a white family he marries into pushes him to the breaking point. Inspired by a shocking true story that took place in 1900, THE CHANT OF JIMMIE BLACKSMITH is a searing and subversive attack on a shameful national legacy.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-chant-of-jimmie-blacksmith

When her husband’s poet cousin (Soumitra Chatterjee) comes to stay with them, Charulata finds herself both creatively inspired and dangerously drawn to him.

In a fateful bumper-car collision, Jake and Ella meet and become the most loving couple in the long history of romance. But when a scheming “other” woman drives a wedge of jealousy into their perfect courtship, insecurity and hatred seemingly doom their affair.

CHE: Part One,Steven Soderbergh,France,2008,2.23,"Far from a conventional biopic, Steven Soderbergh’s film about Che Guevara is a fascinating exploration of the revolutionary as icon. Daring in its refusal to make the socialist leader into an easy martyr or hero, CHE paints a vivid, naturalistic portrait of the man himself (Benicio Del Toro, in a stunning, Cannes-award-winning performance), from his overthrow of the Batista dictatorship to his 1964 United Nations trip to the end of his short life. Composed of two parts, the first a kaleidoscopic view of the Cuban Revolution and the second an all-action dramatization of Che’s failed campaign in Bolivia, CHE is Soderbergh’s most epic vision.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/che-1
La chienne,Jean Renoir,France,1931,1.6,"Jean Renoir's ruthless love triangle tale, his second sound film, is a true precursor to his brilliantly bitter THE RULES OF THE GAME, displaying all of the filmmaker's visual genius and fully imbued with his profound humanity. Michel Simon cuts a tragic figure as an unhappily married cashier and amateur painter who becomes so smitten with a prostitute that he refuses to see the obvious: that she and her pimp boyfriend are taking advantage of him. Renoir's elegant compositions and camera movements carry this twisting narrative, a stinging commentary on class and sexual divisions, to an unforgettably ironic conclusion.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-chienne
The Children Are Watching Us,Vittorio De Sica,Italy,1944,1.4,"A very early Vittorio de Sica effort, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US was originally released in Italy as I BAMBINI CI GUARDANO. Director De Sica collaborated with another neorealist pioneer Cesar Zavattini on the screenplay. The film, a morbid melodrama, concerns a young mother who can’t stand the pressures exerted on her by family responsibilities. She deserts her husband and her brood, causing destruction to rain upon them all. Avoiding the rococo gestures and dramatic overstatement that might have attended this film had it been made in Hollywood, De Sica fashions a subtle tale about real people caught up in a real situation. De Sica’s sensitivity towards the younger cast members of THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US would manifest itself in many of his formative films, notably SCIUSCIA and THE BICYCLE THIEF. Made in 1942, the film was not released in Italy until 1944.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-children-are-watching-us

Children of Paradise,Marcel Carné,France,1945,3.17,"Poetic realism reached sublime heights with CHILDREN OF PARADISE, widely considered one of the greatest French films of all time. This nimble depiction of nineteenth-century Paris’s theatrical demimonde, filmed during World War II, follows a mysterious woman (Arletty) loved by four different men (all based on historical figures): an actor, a criminal, a count, and, most poignantly, a mime (Jean-Louis Barrault, in a longing-suffused performance for the ages). With sensitivity and dramatic élan, director Marcel Carné and screenwriter Jacques Prévert resurrect a world teeming with hucksters and aristocrats, thieves and courtesans, pimps and seers.

George Sand (Juliette Binoche) is a celebrated writer known as much for her gender-bending, bohemian lifestyle as for her daring, protofeminist novels. Alfred de Musset (Benoît Magimel) is a poet with a reputation as a dandy and a womanizer. Their passionate, stormy relationship will take them from the salons of Paris to the canals of Venice and inspire the creation of some of their most enduring masterpieces.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/children-of-the-century
Chimes at Midnight,Orson Welles,Spain,1966,1.93,"The crowning achievement of Orson Welles’s extraordinary cinematic career, CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT was the culmination of the filmmaker’s lifelong obsession with Shakespeare’s ultimate rapscallion, Sir John Falstaff. Usually a comic supporting figure, Falstaff—the loyal, often soused friend of King Henry IV’s wayward son Prince Hal—here becomes the focus: a robustly funny and ultimately tragic screen antihero played by Welles with looming, lumbering grace. Integrating elements from both “Henry IV” plays as well as “Richard II,” “Henry V,” and “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” Welles created a gritty and unorthodox Shakespeare film as a lament, he said, “for the death of Merrie England.” Poetic, philosophical, and visceral—with a kinetic centerpiece battle sequence that rivals anything in the director’s body of work—CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT is as monumental as the figure at its heart.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/chimes-at-midnight

A Christmas Tale,Arnaud Desplechin,France,2008,2.53,"In Arnaud Desplechin’s beguiling A CHRISTMAS TALE (UN CONTE DE NOËL), Catherine Deneuve brings her legendary poise to the role of Junon, matriarch of the troubled Vuillard family, who come together at Christmas after she learns she needs a bone marrow transplant from a blood relative. That simple family reunion setup, however, can’t begin to describe the unpredictable, emotionally volatile experience of this film, an inventive, magical drama that’s equal parts merriment and melancholy. Unrequited childhood loves and blinding grudges, brutal outbursts and sudden slapstick, music, movies, and poetry, A CHRISTMAS TALE ties it all together in a marvelously messy package.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/a-christmas-tale
Chronicle of a Summer,Jean Rouch…,France,1961,1.5,"Few films can claim as much influence on the course of cinema history as CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER. The fascinating result of a collaboration between filmmaker-anthropologist Jean Rouch and sociologist Edgar Morin, this vanguard work of what Morin termed cinéma- vérité is a brilliantly conceived and realized sociopolitical diagnosis of the early sixties in France. Simply by interviewing a group of Paris residents in the summer of 1960—beginning with the provocative and eternal question “Are you happy?” and expanding to political issues, including the ongoing Algerian War—Rouch and Morin reveal the hopes and dreams of a wide array of people, from artists to factory workers, from an Italian émigré to an African student. CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER’s penetrative approach gives us a document of a time and place with extraordinary emotional depth.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/chronicle-of-a-summer

La Ciénaga,Lucrecia Martel,Argentina,2001,1.67,"The release of Lucrecia Martel’s LA CIÉNAGA heralded the arrival of an astonishingly vital and original voice in Argentine cinema. With a radical and disturbing take on narrative, beautiful cinematography, and a highly sophisticated use of on- and offscreen sound, Martel turns her tale of a dissolute bourgeois extended family, whiling away the hours of one sweaty, sticky summer, into a cinematic marvel. This visceral take on class, nature, sexuality, and the ways that political turmoil and social stagnation can manifest in human relationships is a drama of extraordinary tactility, and one of the great contemporary film debuts.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-cienaga
Circle of Deceit,Volker Schlöndorff,West Germany,1981,1.82,"Grateful for a respite from his imploding marriage, Hamburg newspaperman Georg (Bruno Ganz) arrives in Beirut to chronicle the bloody Lebanese Civil War. Inside a shell-pitted hotel, Georg and his photographer colleague Hoffman (cult director Jerzy Skolimowski) join a cynical international coterie of competitive fellow journalists. When Georg’s affair with a beautiful German expat (Hanna Schygulla) evolves into something more than an indulgence, Beirut’s whirlpool of brutality threatens to demolish Georg’s neutrality and self-control.

The Circus,Charles Chaplin,United States,1928,1.2,"In the last film he made during the silent era, Charlie Chaplin revels in the art of the circus, paying tribute to the acrobats and pantomimists who inspired his virtuoso pratfalls. After being mistaken for a pickpocket, Chaplin’s Tramp flees into the ring of a traveling circus and soon becomes the star of the show, falling for the troupe’s bareback rider along the way. Despite its famously troubled production, this gag-packed comedy ranks among Chaplin’s finest, thanks to some of the most audacious set pieces of the director-performer’s career, including a close brush with a lion and a climactic tightrope walk with a barrelful of monkeys. THE CIRCUS, which was rereleased in 1969 with a new score by Chaplin, is an uproarious high-wire act that showcases silent cinema’s most popular entertainer at the peak of his comic powers.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-circus

Though this Depression-era smash was made after the advent of sound, Chaplin remained steadfast in his love for the expressive beauty of the pre-talkie form.

He spends his July at a lakeside boardinghouse, nursing crushes on the sixteen-year-old Laura and, more tantalizingly, her long-legged, blonde, older half sister, Claire. Baring her knee on a ladder under a blooming cherry tree, Claire unwittingly incites a moral crisis for Jerôme while creating an image that is both the iconic emblem of Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales and one of French cinema’s most enduring moments.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/claire-s-knee
"Clean, Shaven",Lodge Kerrigan,United States,1994,1.32,"Lodge Kerrigan began his succession of utterly unique, visually and aurally dazzling character studies with the raw, ravaging CLEAN, SHAVEN.

This fiction-documentary hybrid uses a sensational real-life event—the arrest of a young man on charges that he fraudulently impersonated the well-known filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf—as the basis for a stunning, multilayered investigation into movies, identity, artistic creation, and existence, in which the real people from the case play themselves.

She watches helplessly as her own hopes and desires are pushed aside time and again by those of her siblings and parents, until all her chances for happiness evaporate, leaving her crushed and ailing. Experimenting with off-balance compositions, discontinuous editing, and a densely layered soundtrack, Ghatak devised an intellectually ambitious and emotionally devastating new shape for the melodrama, lamenting the tragedies of Indian history and the inequities of traditional gender roles while blazing a formal trail for the generations of Indian filmmakers who have followed him.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-cloud-capped-star

The always extraordinary Juliette Binoche is stirring as Maria, a stage and screen icon who is being courted to star in a new production of the play that made her famous—only this time she must assume the role of the older woman. Kristen Stewart matches her punch for punch as her beleaguered assistant, called upon to provide support both professional and emotional for her mercurial boss. And Chloë Grace Moretz is Maria’s callow new castmate, a starlet waiting in the wings. An amorphous, soul-searching tale, filled with ethereal images of its Swiss Alps setting, CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA brilliantly dramatizes one woman’s reckoning with herself and the world.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/clouds-of-sils-maria
Code Unknown,Michael Haneke,France,2000,1.95,"One of the world’s most influential and provocative filmmakers, the Oscar–winning Austrian director Michael Haneke diagnoses the social maladies of contemporary Europe with devastating precision and artistry. His drama CODE UNKNOWN, the first of his many films made in France, may be his most inspired work. Composed almost entirely of brilliantly shot, single-take vignettes focusing on characters connected to one seemingly minor incident on a Paris street, Haneke’s film—with an outstanding international cast headlined by Juliette Binoche—is a revelatory examination of racial inequality and the failure of communication in an increasingly diverse modern landscape.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/code-unknown

Drawing from his own youthful experiences, Assayas revisits the outskirts of Paris in the early 1970s, telling the story of teenage lovers Gilles (Cyprien Fouquet) and Christine (Virginie Ledoyen), whose rebellions against family and society threaten to tear them apart. The visceral realism of the movie’s narrative and the near experimentalism of its camera work come together effortlessly thanks in part to a rock soundtrack that vividly evokes the period.

With pressure mounting from a local gallery owner to deliver his next masterpiece, Adam sets about procuring as much glorious hemoglobin as he can muster—first from himself, then from anyone unfortunate enough to pass by his sickening studio of slaughter.

The Color of Pomegranates,Sergei Parajanov,Soviet Union,1969,1.33,"A breathtaking fusion of poetry, ethnography, and cinema, Sergei Parajanov’s masterwork overflows with unforgettable images and sounds. In a series of tableaux that blend the tactile with the abstract, THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES revives the splendors of Armenian culture through the story of the eighteenth-century troubadour Sayat-Nova, charting his intellectual, artistic, and spiritual growth through iconographic compositions rather than traditional narrative. The film’s tapestry of folklore and metaphor departed from the realism that dominated the Soviet cinema of its era, leading authorities to block its distribution, with rare underground screenings presenting it in a restructured form. This edition features the cut closest to Parajanov’s original vision, in a restoration that brings new life to one of cinema’s most enigmatic meditations on art and beauty.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-color-of-pomegranates

Rather than the adventure and glory he envisioned, what he finds is a waking nightmare of unimaginable carnage and cruelty—rendered with a feverish, otherworldly intensity by Klimov’s subjective camera work and expressionistic sound design.

Le Corbeau,Henri-Georges Clouzot,France,1943,1.52,"A mysterious writer of poison-pen letters, known only as Le Corbeau (the Raven), plagues a French provincial town, unwittingly exposing the collective suspicion and rancor seething beneath the community’s calm surface. Made during the Nazi Occupation of France, Henri-Georges Clouzot’s LE CORBEAU was attacked by the right-wing Vichy regime, the left-wing Resistance press, and the Catholic Church, and it was banned after the Liberation. But some—including Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre—recognized the powerful subtext to Clouzot’s anti-informant, anti-Gestapo fable, and worked to rehabilitate Clouzot’s directorial reputation after the war. LE CORBEAU brilliantly captures a spirit of paranoid pettiness and self-loathing turning an occupied French town into a twentieth-century Salem.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/le-corbeau

A semiautobiographical retelling of the director’s own training for the priesthood, THE DEVIL’S PLAYGROUND follows thirteen-year-old Tom Allen (Simon Burke), a serious-minded boy whose calling for the church is complicated by guilt associated with his awakening sexuality and “sinful” thoughts. While the ascetic Brother Francine (Arthur Dignam) prowls the school’s corridors looking for evidence of “the undisciplined mind,” the hard-drinking Brother Victor (Nick Tate) pushes back against the harsh discipline that scars the hearts and minds of the students as each battles a desire to consummate the pleasures of the flesh.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-devil-s-playground
Dheepan,Jacques Audiard,France,2015,1.9,"With this Palme d’Or–winning drama, which deftly combines seemingly disparate genres, French filmmaker Jacques Audiard cemented his status as a titan of contemporary world cinema. In an arresting performance, the nonprofessional actor Antonythasan Jesuthasan (himself a former child soldier) stars as a Tamil fighter who, along with a woman and a child posing as his wife and daughter, flees war-torn Sri Lanka only to land in a Paris suburb blighted by drugs. As the makeshift family embarks on a new life, DHEEPAN settles into an intimate social-realist mode before tightening into a dynamic turf-war thriller, as well as an unsettling study of the psychological aftereffects of combat. Searing and sensitive, Audiard’s film is a unique depiction of the refugee experience as a continuous crisis of identity.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/dheepan
Diabolique,Henri-Georges Clouzot,France,1955,1.95,"Before PSYCHO, PEEPING TOM, and REPULSION, there was DIABOLIQUE.

Diamantino,Gabriel Abrantes and Daniel Schmidt,Brazil,2018,1.6,"When bighearted but dim-witted Portuguese soccer hunk Diamantino (Carloto Cotta) blows it in the World Cup finals, he goes from superstar to laughing stock overnight. His sheltered worldview is further shattered after learning about the European refugee crisis, and he resolves to make amends by adopting an African refugee—only to find that his new “son” is actually an undercover lesbian tax auditor investigating him on the suspicion of corruption. From there, Diamantino gets swept up in a gonzo comic odyssey involving cigarette-smoking evil twins, Secret Service skullduggery, mad-science genetic modification, and a right-wing anti-EU conspiracy. Vividly photographed in Super 16 mm and featuring the biggest stampedes of giant Pekingese puppies you’ve ever seen, Gabriel Abrantes and Daniel Schmidt’s genre-blending and gender-bending satire is a high-camp masterpiece.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/diamantino
Diamonds of the Night,Jan Němec,Czechoslovakia,1964,1.12,"With this simultaneously harrowing and lyrical debut feature, Jan Němec established himself as the most uncompromising visionary among the radical filmmakers who made up the Czechoslovak New Wave. Adapted from a novel by Arnošt Lustig, DIAMONDS OF THE NIGHT closely tracks two boys who escape from a concentration-camp transport and flee into the surrounding woods, hostile terrain where the brute realities of survival coexist with dreams, memories, and fragments of visual poetry. Along with visceral camera work by Jaroslav Kučera and Miroslav Ondříček—two of Czechoslovak cinema’s most influential cinematographers—Němec makes inventive use of fractured editing, elliptical storytelling, and flights of surrealism as he strips context away from this bare-bones tale, evoking the panicked delirium of consciousness lost in night and fog.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/diamonds-of-the-night

Dillinger Is Dead,Marco Ferreri,Italy,1969,1.57,"In this magnificently inscrutable late-sixties masterpiece, Marco Ferreri, one of European cinema’s most idiosyncratic auteurs, takes us through the looking glass to one seemingly routine night in the life of an Italian gas mask designer, played, in a tour de force performance, by New Wave icon Michel Piccoli. In his claustrophobic mod home, he pampers his pill-popping wife, seduces his maid, and uncovers a gun that may have once been owned by John Dillinger—and then things get even stranger. A surreal political missive about social malaise, DILLINGER IS DEAD (DILLINGER È MORTO) finds absurdity in the mundane.

Diplomacy,Volker Schlöndorff,France,2014,1.38,"As the Allies march toward Paris in the summer of 1944, Hitler gives orders that the French capital should not fall into enemy hands, or if it does, then “only as a field of rubble.” The person assigned to carry out this barbaric act is General Dietrich von Choltitz (Niels Arestrup), who already has mines planted on the Eiffel Tower, in the Louvre and Notre Dame, and on the bridges over the Seine. Nothing should be left as a reminder of the city’s former glory.

The Divorce of Lady X,Tim Whelan,United Kingdom,1938,1.52,"Droll comedy of manners and morals that was based on a play and made as a film once before in 1932 as COUNSEL'S OPINION, directed by Allan Dwan. The four screenwriters' literate script of Biro's adaptation of the stage work takes Oberon to a London hotel where she is attending a costume party. The weather turns foul and she must spend the night at the hostelry with several other ladies who were unable to make it home. Olivier is a young lawyer occupying a suite and the manager prevails on him to give up some of the space in his copious quarters, but Olivier is adamant until Oberon uses her wiles on him. The result is that she gets the comfortable bed and Olivier must snooze on the floor in the next room. In the morning, she leaves before he can find out anything about this fascinating and attractive woman. Her alacrity causes him to wonder if she's married. When he arrives at his office, an old school chum contacts him and wants Olivier to handle his divorce. The man is sure his wife spent the night with another man at the same hotel we've seen earlier. Olivier can't believe this nerd could be married to Oberon. He isn't, of course, and his wife is someone else entirely. But Olivier doesn't know that yet. So it gets down to one of those British drawing-room farces where identities are mistaken, accusations are made, absurd situations occur, and Olivier and Oberon are together at the finale. Richardson is very funny as the man who wants a divorce from wife Barnes, who has been married thrice before and has backhanded fidelity on many other occasions. Oberon shows she can play light comedy as well as some of the heavier work she had to do over the years. The Technicolor tinting was supervised by long-time advisor Natalie Kalmus and, although it lent a nice air to the already-airy material, it was totally unnecessary.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-divorce-of-lady-x

Despite its patchwork origins, FEARLESS HYENA 2 packs in enough breathless battles—and some choice Chan footage that would otherwise have been left on the cutting-room floor—to make it a worthy follow-up.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/fearless-hyena-2
The Fearless Hyena,Jackie Chan,Hong Kong,1979,1.63,"Jackie Chan made his directorial debut with this rollicking martial-arts comedy, a fiercely entertaining showcase for his superhuman agility and daredevil spirit.

Festival,Murray Lerner,United States,1967,1.63,"Before WOODSTOCK and MONTEREY POP, there was FESTIVAL. From 1963 through 1966, Murray Lerner visited the annual Newport Folk Festival to document a thriving, idealistic musical movement as it reached its peak as a popular phenomenon. Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Howlin’ Wolf, Johnny Cash, the Staple Singers, Pete Seeger, Son House, and Peter, Paul and Mary were just a few of the legends who shared the stage at Newport, treating audiences to a range of folk music that encompassed the genre’s roots in blues, country, and gospel as well as its newer flirtations with rock and roll. Shooting in gorgeous black and white, Lerner juxtaposes performances with snapshot interviews with artists and their fans, weaving footage from four years of the festival into an intimate record of a pivotal time in music—and in American culture at large.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/festival
F for Fake,Orson Welles,United States,1975,1.47,"Trickery. Deceit. Magic. In F FOR FAKE, a free-form sort-of documentary by Orson Welles, the legendary filmmaker (and self-described charlatan) gleefully reengages with the central preoccupation of his career: the tenuous lines between illusion and truth, art and lies. Beginning with portraits of the world-renowned art forger Elmyr de Hory and his equally devious biographer, Clifford Irving, Welles embarks on a dizzying journey that simultaneously exposes and revels in fakery and fakers of all stripes, not the least of whom is Welles himself. Charming and inventive, F FOR FAKE is an inspired prank and a clever examination of the essential duplicity of cinema.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/f-for-fake

Nearby, we bear witness as thousands of men, women, and children risk their lives to make the brutal crossing from Africa.

The Firemen’s Ball,Miloš Forman,Czechoslovakia,1967,1.22,"A milestone of the Czech New Wave, Miloš Forman’s first color film THE FIREMEN’S BALL is both a dazzling comedy and a provocative political satire. A hilarious saga of good intentions confounded, the story chronicles a firemen’s ball where nothing goes right, from a beauty pageant whose reluctant participants embarrass the organizers to a lottery from which nearly all the prizes are pilfered. Presumed to be a commentary on the floundering Czech leadership, the film was “banned forever” in Czechoslovakia following the Russian invasion and prompted Forman’s move to America.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-firemen-s-ball

The Fire Within,Louis Malle,France,1963,1.8,"After garnering international acclaim for such seminal crowd-pleasers as THE LOVERS and ZAZIE DANS LE MÉTRO, Louis Malle gave his fans a shock with THE FIRE WITHIN (LE FEU FOLLET), a penetrating study of individual and social inertia. Maurice Ronet (ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS), in an implosive, haunted performance, plays Alain Leroy, a self-destructive writer who resolves to kill himself and spends the next twenty-four hours trying to reconnect with a host of wayward friends. Unsparing in its portrait of Alain’s inner turmoil and shot with remarkable clarity, THE FIRE WITHIN is one of Malle’s darkest and most personal films.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-fire-within

Mia’s adolescent conflicts and emerging sexuality reach a boiling point when her mother’s new boyfriend (a lethally attractive Michael Fassbender) enters the picture. In her young career, Arnold has already proven herself to be a master of social realism, evoking the work of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach; and she invests her sympathetic portraits of dead-end lives with a poetic, earthy sensibility all her own.

With its coolly assured style, shocking perversity, and savage gallows humor, FISTS IN THE POCKET (I PUGNI IN TASCA) was a gleaming ice pick in the eye of bourgeois family values and Catholic morality, a truly unique work that continues to rank as one of the great achievements of Italian cinema.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/fists-in-the-pocket

Enamored by the power and confidence of the strong community of girls, Toni spends less and less time boxing with her older brother, and instead eagerly absorbs the dance routines and masters drills from a distance, even piercing her own ears in an effort to fit in. But when a mysterious outbreak of fainting spells plagues the team, Toni’s desire for acceptance becomes more complicated.

The Flavor of Green Tea over Rice,Yasujiro Ozu,Japan,1952,1.93,"One of the ineffably lovely domestic sagas made by Yasujiro Ozu at the height of his mastery, THE FLAVOR OF GREEN TEA OVER RICE is a sublimely piercing portrait of a marriage coming quietly undone. Secrets and deceptions strain the already tenuous relationship of a childless, middle-aged couple, as the wife’s city-bred sophistication bumps up against the husband’s small-town simplicity, and a generational sea change—in the form of her headstrong, modern niece—sweeps over their household. The director’s abiding concern with family dynamics receives one of its most spirited treatments, with a wry, tender humor and buoyant expansiveness that moves the action from the home into the baseball stadiums, pachinko parlors, and ramen shops of postwar Tokyo.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-flavor-of-green-tea-over-rice

Setting his later version in a seaside location, Ozu otherwise preserves the details of his elegantly simple plot wherein an aging actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his former lover and illegitimate son, a scenario that enrages his current mistress and results in heartbreak for all. Together, the films offer a unique glimpse into the evolution of one of cinema’s greatest directors. A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS reveals Ozu in the midst of developing his mode of expression; FLOATING WEEDS reveals his distinct style at its pinnacle. In each, the director captures the joy and sadness in everyday life.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/floating-weeds

Flowing,Mikio Naruse,Japan,1956,1.93,"Many viewers will likely find elements in Mikio Naruse's Flowing (aka Nagageru) (1956) that recall Kenji Mizoguchi's earlier Street of Shame and The Life of Oharu -- its story of the denizens of a geisha house that is slowly sinking in debt and a changing world echoes key aspects of both films, especially with Kinoyu Tanaka playing a role here, as the brothel operator, similar to her part in Mizoguchis Life of Oharu. But with Naruse's frequent leading actress Hideko Takemine as the daughter, his own stamp is quite visible throughout the proceedings. Still others may find it a kind of Japanese answer to Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, as a story about lost souls in a decaying surrounded by a changing world. The vivid textures of the acting and characterizations transcend the particulars of its setting, however, and the performances of the two lead actresses impart a universally accessible urgency to the story.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/flowing
The Flying Ace,Richard E. Norman,United States,1926,1.08,"Unlike his 1923 film REGENERATION, Richard Norman’s THE FLYING ACE exists in its entirety, and the image quality is stunning. A rural crime drama revolving around a pair of rival aviators, THE FLYING ACE illuminates the fact that many films made for African American audiences were less concerned with race than with making popular entertainment in the traditional Hollywood style. Filmed in the Arlington area of Jacksonville, Florida, THE FLYING ACE is a unique aviation melodrama in that no airplanes actually leave the ground (the spectacular flight scenes being performed on terra firma, in front of neutral backdrops). Norman divided the film into four chapters, so that exhibitors could show the film as a feature or as a four-episode serial. The film is buoyed by the presence of Norman Studios regular Steve “Peg” Reynolds as the hero’s one-legged sidekick, who in one memorable scene rides a bicycle while firing a rifle built into the shaft of his crutch.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-flying-ace
Following,Christopher Nolan,United Kingdom,1999,1.17,"Before he became a sensation with the twisty revenge story MEMENTO, Christopher Nolan fashioned this low-budget, 16 mm black-and-white neonoir with comparable precision and cunning. Providing irrefutable evidence of Nolan’s directorial bravura, FOLLOWING is the fragmented tale of an unemployed young writer who trails strangers through London, hoping that they will provide inspiration for his first novel. He gets more than he bargained for when one of his unwitting subjects leads him down a dark criminal path. With gritty aesthetics and a made-on-the-fly vibe (many shots were simply stolen on the streets, unbeknownst to passersby), FOLLOWING is a mind-bending psychological journey that shows the remarkable beginnings of one of today’s most acclaimed filmmakers.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/following
Footlight Parade,Lloyd Bacon,United States,1933,1.72,"FOOTLIGHT PARADE is sheer cinematic joy. In this Depression-era romp, a timid stenographer (Ruby Keeler) removes her glasses and—wow!—she’s a star. A gee-whiz tenor (Dick Powell) asserts his independence. Plucky chorines tap, greedy hangers-on get their comeuppances, and an indefatigable producer/dancer (James Cagney) and his girl Friday (Joan Blondell) work showbiz miracles to stage live prologues for talkie houses to keep their company afloat during hard times. “Honeymoon Hotel,” “By a Waterfall,” and “Shanghai Lil” are the shows, directed by Busby Berkeley and filled with imagination-bending sets, startling camera angles, kaleidoscopic pageantry, and a twenty-thousand-gallon-per-minute waterfall.

For All Mankind,Al Reinert,United States,1989,1.33,"In July 1969, the space race ended when Apollo 11 fulfilled President Kennedy’s challenge of “landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” No one who witnessed the lunar landing will ever forget it. Al Reinert’s documentary FOR ALL MANKIND is the story of the twenty-four men who traveled to the moon, told in their words, in their voices, using the images of their experiences.

Foreign Correspondent,Alfred Hitchcock,United States,1940,2.0,"In 1940, Alfred Hitchcock made his official transition from the British film industry to Hollywood. And it was quite a year: his first two American movies, REBECCA and FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, were both nominated for the best picture Oscar. Though REBECCA prevailed, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT is the more quintessential Hitch film. A full-throttle espionage thriller, starring Joel McCrea as a green Yank reporter sent to Europe to get the scoop on the imminent war, it’s wall-to-wall witty repartee, head-spinning plot twists, and brilliantly mounted suspense set pieces, including an ocean plane crash climax with astonishing special effects. FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT deserves to be mentioned alongside THE 39 STEPS and NORTH BY NORTHWEST as one of the master’s greatest adventures.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/foreign-correspondent

Set at the end of the nineteenth century, THE FOUR FEATHERS follows the travails of a young officer (John Clements) accused of cowardice after he resigns his post on the eve of a major deployment to Khartoum; he must then fight to redeem himself in the eyes of his fellow officers (including Ralph Richardson) and fiancée (June Duprez).

Fox and His Friends,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1975,2.07,"A lottery win leads not to financial and emotional freedom but to social captivity, in this wildly cynical classic about love and exploitation by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Casting himself against type, the director plays a suggestible working-class innocent who lets himself be taken advantage of by his bourgeois new boyfriend and his circle of materialistic friends, leading to the kind of resonant misery that only Fassbinder could create. FOX AND HIS FRIENDS is unsparing social commentary, an amusingly pitiless and groundbreaking if controversial depiction of a gay community in 1970s West Germany.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/fox-and-his-friends

It is a voyage Chantal Akerman wanted to make shortly after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, “before it was too late,” reconstructing her impressions in the manner of a documentary on the border of fiction.

For years, undocumented immigrants passed through San Diego, until the use of new technology began stemming the flow of people. This leaves only the mountains and deserts of Arizona for those desperate enough to try their luck. And it is here that Akerman shifts her focus, between Agua Prieta, Sonora, and Douglas, Arizona, and the desert in between. Mixing evocative landscapes and interviews with the families of immigrants, American sheriffs, local residents, and advocates, she creates a profound, compassionate reflection on U.S. border policy and xenophobia.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/from-the-other-side

Frownland,Ronald Bronstein,United States,2007,1.77,"Longtime Safdie brothers collaborator Ronald Bronstein has described his lone directorial effort as “a rotten egg lobbed with bad aim at the silver screen.” Be forewarned: audience response has been intensely divided. FROWNLAND has garnered both passionate raves and scathing denunciations, while festival screenings have ended in screaming matches between patrons. It's strong stuff, yes, but none of its notorious reputation does justice to its savage dark humor, emotional heft, and stylistic audacity. Above all else, FROWNLAND is a pitch-black character study of Keith Sontag (Dore Mann), a neurotic, manipulative, stridently unlovable New Yorker whose pitiless roommate aptly describes him, to his face, as “a burbling troll in his underwear.” With the most basic elements of human communication a struggle, Keith lurches his way through an uncaring city, attempting to aid a suicidal friend, evict his unctuous roommate, and simply attain some measure of self-respect.

In a series of escalating “games,” the sadistic duo subject their victims to unspeakable physical and psychological torture over the course of a night. A home-invasion thriller in which the genre’s threat of bloodshed is made stomach-churningly real, the film ratchets up shocks even as its executioners interrupt the action to address the audience, drawing queasy attention to the way that cinema milks pleasure from pain and stokes our appetite for atrocity. With this controversial treatise on violence and entertainment, Haneke issued a summation of his cinematic philosophy, implicating his audience in a spectacle of unbearable cruelty.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/funny-games

The Gates,"Albert Maysles, David Maysles, Antonio Ferrera, and Matthew Prinzing",United States,2007,1.57,"In 1979, artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude proposed one of the largest artworks in history: a “golden river” of 7,503 fabric-paneled gates in Central Park. While Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s artistic vision sought to unite all of New York City, the public likened the project to the “defacement of a masterpiece,” akin to putting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. Over twenty years later, under a new mayor, the project was approved and finally completed in February 2005. THE GATES chronicles the evolution of the project from concept to realization, as it ultimately overcomes public disapproval and transforms Central Park into a visual symphony of color and light. The work—which was entirely financed by the artists and which ultimately brought over four million visitors from around the world to Central Park in midwinter—has been lovingly memorialized in this fascinating look at the creation of a modern masterpiece.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-gates
General Idi Amin Dada: A Self-Portrait,Barbet Schroeder,France,1974,1.5,"In 1974, Barbet Schroeder went to Uganda to make a film about Idi Amin, the country’s ruthless, charismatic dictator. Three years into a murderous regime that would be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans, Amin prepared a triumphal greeting for the filmmakers, staging rallies, military maneuvers, and cheery displays of national pride, and envisioning the film as an official portrait to adorn his cult of personality. Schroeder, however, had other ideas, emerging with a disquieting, caustically funny brief against Amin, in which the dictator’s own endless stream of testimony—by turns charming, menacing, and nonsensical—serves as the most damning evidence. A revelatory tug-of-war between subject and filmmaker, GENERAL IDI AMIN DADA: A SELF-PORTRAIT is a landmark in the art of documentary and an appalling study of egotism in power.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/general-idi-amin-dada-a-self-portrait

She recalls the initial, furtive glances in her father’s bookstore, her elaborate sexual fantasies, and their long-awaited consummation. Most important of all is the motorcycle itself, a gift from Daniel that seems to give her more pleasure than any man could deliver.

The Gleaners and I,Agnès Varda,France,2000,1.37,"Agnès Varda’s extraordinary late-career renaissance began with this wonderfully idiosyncratic, self-reflexive documentary in which the French cinema icon explores the world of modern-day gleaners: those living on the margins who survive by foraging for what society throws away. Embracing the intimacy and freedom of digital filmmaking, Varda posits herself as a kind of gleaner of images and ideas, one whose generous, expansive vision makes room for ruminations on everything from aging to the birth of cinema to the beauty of heart-shaped potatoes. By turns playful, philosophical, and subtly political, THE GLEANERS AND I is a warmly human reflection on the contradictions of our consumerist world from an artist who, like her subjects, finds unexpected richness where few think to look.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-gleaners-and-i

Revisiting many of the original film’s subjects to explore the often unexpected effects that their participation in the project has had on their lives, this wonderfully warm and human epilogue once again takes gleaning as the starting point from which to explore what most interests Varda: the richness, complexity, and poignancy of life outside the mainstream.

Ozu weaves a wealth of subtle gags through a family portrait as rich as those of his dramatic films, mocking the foibles of the adult world through the eyes of his child protagonists. Shot in stunning color and set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new washing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door salesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I WAS BORN, BUT . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/good-morning

In it, Gray, with typical sardonic relish, chronicles his arduous journey through the diagnosis and treatment of a rare and alarming ocular condition.

Featuring Jack Oakie and Paulette Goddard in stellar supporting turns, THE GREAT DICTATOR, boldly going after the fascist leader before the U.S.’s official entry into World War II, is an audacious amalgam of politics and slapstick that culminates in Chaplin’s famously impassioned speech.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-great-dictator

Gold’s investigation, following the murder of an elderly Jewish candy-shop owner, leads him down a path of obscure encounters and clues, to a profound reckoning with his own identity. Filled with Mamet’s trademark verbal play and featuring standout supporting performances from William H.

In Vanda’s Room,Pedro Costa,Portugal,2000,2.83,"For the extraordinarily beautiful second film in his Fontainhas trilogy, Pedro Costa jettisoned his earlier films' larger crews to burrow even deeper into the Lisbon ghetto and the lives of its desperate inhabitants. With the intimate feel of a documentary and the texture of a Vermeer painting, IN VANDA'S ROOM takes an unflinching, fragmentary look at a handful of self-destructive, marginalized people, but is centered around the heroin-addicted Vanda Duarte. Costa presents the daily routines of Vanda and her neighbors with disarming matter-of-factness, and through his camera, individuals whom many would deem disposable become vivid and vital. This was Costa's first use of digital video, and the evocative images he created remain some of the medium's most astonishing.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/in-vanda-s-room

Coward and Lean ended up codirecting the large-scale project—an impressive undertaking, especially considering that neither of them had directed for the big screen before (this would be Coward’s only such credit).

What she finds is a behind-the-scenes tangle of barely controlled chaos as egos clash, romantic attractions simmer, and an obsessive director (a cannily cast Jean-Pierre Léaud) drives himself to the brink to realize his vision. Blending blasts of silent cinema, martial arts flicks, and the music of Sonic Youth and Ali Farka Touré into a hallucinatory swirl of postmodern cool, Assayas composes a witty reflection on the nineties French film industry and the eternal tension between art and commercial entertainment.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/irma-vep

Darkly comic and insinuatingly hypnotic, this tantalizingly cryptic puzzle film finds Lanthimos first working through the themes of power and control that he would explore to increasing renown in art-house sensations like DOGTOOTH, THE LOBSTER, and THE FAVOURITE.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/kinetta

KINGS ROW is one of Warner Bros.’ most distinguished and sensational productions, highlighted by an outstanding cast, haunting James Wong Howe cinematography, and an emotionally charged score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.

When a young hitchhiker joins a couple on a weekend yacht trip, psychological warfare breaks out as the two men compete for the woman’s attention. A storm forces the small crew below deck, and tension builds to a violent climax. With stinging dialogue and a mercilessly probing camera, Polanski creates a disturbing study of fear, humiliation, sexuality, and aggression.

HAPPINESS’s grim New Jersey setting is transposed mainly to sunny Florida, but the biggest twist is that new actors fill the roles from the earlier film—including Shirley Henderson, Allison Janney, and Ally Sheedy as alarmingly dissimilar sisters, and Ciarán Hinds hauntingly embodying a reformed pedophile. Shot in expressionistic tones by cinematographer extraordinaire Ed Lachman, Solondz’s film finds the humor in the tragic and the tragic in the everyday.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/life-during-wartime

An elegant mix of the comic and the tragic, this poignant movie also features Buster Keaton in an extended cameo, marking the only time the two silent comedy icons appeared in a film together.

Suffused with both enchantment and melancholy, this autobiographical film takes on the perspective of a quiet, lonely boy growing up in Liverpool in the 1950s.

Manila in the Claws of Light,Lino Brocka,Philippines,1975,2.1,"Lino Brocka achieved international acclaim with this candid portrait of 1970s Manila, a breakout example of the more serious-minded filmmaking the director had turned to after building a career on mainstream movies he described as “soaps.” A young fisherman from a provincial village arrives in the capital on a quest to track down his girlfriend, who was lured there with the promise of work and hasn’t been heard from since. In the meantime, he takes a low-wage job at a construction site and witnesses life on the streets, where death strikes without warning, corruption and exploitation are commonplace, and protests hint at escalating civil unrest.

Marathon,Carlos Saura,Sweden,1993,2.17,"Carlos Saura's film of the Games of the XXV Olympiad Barcelona 1992 brings a visual flair and humanism that paid excellent tribute to the Games and to the Catalan capital. The title event, the men's marathon, was chosen both as symbol and leitmotif, in part because the race took place in the streets of Barcelona, but also because of the effort and endurance required in this most arduous of Olympic events. Saura was excited at the prospect of delivering a film that would run approximately the same length as the time a men's marathon winner might achieve, hence this director's cut of MARATHON at two hours and ten minutes.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/marathon-1

Based on a novel by Vladislav Vančura, this stirring and poetic depiction of a feud between two rival medieval clans is a fierce, epic, and meticulously designed evocation of the clashes between Christianity and paganism, humankind and nature, love and violence. Vláčil’s approach was to re-create the textures and mentalities of a long-ago way of life, rather than to make a conventional historical drama, and the result is dazzling.

Unemployment is rampant in London’s working-class East End, where a middle-aged couple and their two sons languish in a claustrophobic public-housing flat. As the brothers (Phil Daniels and Tim Roth) grow increasingly disaffected, Leigh punctuates the grinding boredom of their daily existence with tense encounters, including with a priggish aunt (Marion Bailey) who has managed to become middle-class and a blithering skinhead on the verge of psychosis (a scene-stealing Gary Oldman, in his first major role).

After his wife and family flee in the wake of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the bourgeois intellectual Sergio (Sergio Corrieri) passes his days wandering Havana in idle reflection, his amorous entanglements and political ambivalence gradually giving way to a mounting sense of alienation. With this adaptation of an innovative novel by Edmundo Desnoes, Gutiérrez Alea developed a cinematic style as radical as the times he was chronicling, creating a collage of vivid impressions through the use of experimental editing techniques, archival material, and spontaneously shot street scenes.

Taking place on the last day of Mishima’s life, when he famously committed public seppuku, the film is punctuated by extended flashbacks to the writer’s past as well as gloriously stylized evocations of his fictional works.

Marin,United States,1942,1.43,"As Shirley Temple grew up before the eyes of America, this delightful comeback vehicle offered her a chance to shine in a new kind of film: a charming teenage romance, complete with jive-talking, jitterbug-mad bobby soxers. She displays her patented pluck (and receives her first on-screen kiss) as starry-eyed fourteen-year-old Annie Rooney, who pines for nerdy classmate Marty (Dickie Moore) even though his wealthy family looks down on her working-class background. When Annie’s father (William Gargan) invents a new form of synthetic rubber, however, it may just be her ticket to love.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/miss-annie-rooney

MISS JULIE vividly depicts the battle of the sexes and classes that ensues when a wealthy businessman’s daughter (Anita Björk, in a fiercely emotional performance) falls for her father’s bitter servant. Celebrated for its unique cinematic style (and censored upon its first release in the United States for its adult content), Sjöberg’s film was an important turning point in Scandinavian cinema.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/miss-julie
Mister Johnson,Bruce Beresford,United States,1990,1.68,"A decade after he broke through with BREAKER MORANT, Australian director Bruce Beresford made another acclaimed film about the effects of colonialism on the individual. In a performance that earned him the Berlin Film Festival’s Silver Bear for best actor, Maynard Eziashi plays the title character, a Nigerian villager eager to work as a civil servant for the British authorities, including a sympathetic district officer (Pierce Brosnan), in the hope that it will benefit him in the future.

Brilliantly embracing his inner cad, Brooks stars as Robert Cole, a neurotic Hollywood film editor whose rollercoaster romance with remarkably forgiving bank executive Mary Harvard (Kathryn Harrold) is constantly undercut by his doubts about their relationship. When Robert breaks things off in order to explore other options, he risks losing the best thing he’s ever had.

Modern Times,Charles Chaplin,United States,1936,1.45,"MODERN TIMES, Charlie Chaplin’s last outing as the Little Tramp, puts the iconic character to work as a giddily inept factory employee who becomes smitten with a gorgeous gamine (Paulette Goddard).

Charting his rise and fall with a single-minded focus on the bloody business at hand, the film is at once gritty and operatic, placing the viewer right in the thick of the ring’s action, as close to death as possible. Like all of the great Italian truth seeker’s films, this is not just an electrifying drama but also a profound and moving inquiry into a violent world—and it’s perhaps the greatest bullfighting movie ever made.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-moment-of-truth

A trio of people (Gerard Depardieu, Nicole Garcia, Roger Pierre) are presented as “case histories” by a lecturer—and we see them not only in their work environments, but also in terms of the cinematic role models (Jean Gabin, Jean Marais, Danielle Darrieux) that have helped shape their self-images.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/mon-oncle-d-amerique

Mr. Klein,Joseph Losey,France,1976,2.05,"Neglected for decades, this chilling existentialist mystery has reemerged as one of director Joseph Losey’s most virtuosic works. In perhaps the finest performance of his career, Alain Delon stars as the wealthy Robert Klein, an amoral art dealer in Nazi-occupied Paris who exploits the persecution of his Jewish countrymen by buying and selling their paintings. When Klein is mistaken for a Jewish man of the same name, he is plunged into a labyrinthine identity crisis with life-or-death consequences.

Monsieur Verdoux,Charles Chaplin,United States,1947,2.07,"Charlie Chaplin plays shockingly against type in his most controversial film, a brilliant and bleak black comedy about money, marriage, and murder. Chaplin is a twentieth-century bluebeard, an enigmatic family man who goes to extreme lengths to support his wife and child, attempting to bump off a series of wealthy widows (including one played by the indefatigable Martha Raye, in a hilarious performance).

With his characteristic vérité style—and a camera crew that included the likes of Albert Maysles and Richard Leacock—D. A.

Never Fear,Ida Lupino,United States,1950,1.35,"With the polio epidemic striking terror in the hearts of millions—in 1949, it caused more than 2,700 deaths in the U.S. alone—Ida Lupino made this semiautobiographical melodrama about a dancer-choreographer (Sally Forrest) who struggles to overcome the disease that has crippled her body and her confidence. The film’s unusually hard-eyed realism was born of Lupino’s own dark memories of polio as an aspiring teenage actress, as well as her use of documentary locations and nonprofessional actors—most tenderly in the famous wheelchair square dance filmed (by veteran John Ford cinematographer Archie Stout) with actual rehab patients at the Kabat-Kaiser Institute in Santa Monica.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/never-fear

Night of the Living Dead,George A. Romero,United States,1968,1.6,"Shot outside Pittsburgh on a shoestring budget, by a band of filmmakers determined to make their mark, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, directed by horror master George A. Romero, is a great story of independent cinema: a midnight hit turned box-office smash that became one of the most influential films of all time. A deceptively simple tale of a group of strangers trapped in a farmhouse who find themselves fending off a horde of recently dead, flesh-eating ghouls, Romero’s claustrophobic vision of a late-1960s America literally tearing itself apart rewrote the rules of the horror genre, combined gruesome gore with acute social commentary, and quietly broke ground by casting a black actor (Duane Jones) in its lead role.

Jim Jarmusch assembled an extraordinary international cast of actors (including Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Béatrice Dalle, and Roberto Benigni) for this quintet of transitory tales of urban displacement and existential angst, all staged as encounters between cabbies and their fares. Spanning time zones, continents, and languages, NIGHT ON EARTH winds its course through scenes of uproarious comedy, nocturnal poetry, and somber fatalism, set to a moody soundtrack by Tom Waits.

In his unforgettable rendering of Walter Lord’s book of the same name, the acclaimed British director Roy Ward Baker depicts with sensitivity, awe, and a fine sense of tragedy the ship’s last hours.

Warned that another exposure would prove fatal, Dmitriy nevertheless refuses a safer job and continues the experimentation. Lyolya, Dmitriy's girl friend, feels that their relationship means little to him and decides to marry their best friend, theoretician Ilya Kulikov.

From the outset of the marriage, Dmitriy's singular devotion to his work keeps them apart. At a Siberian research center, Dmitriy works together with Ilya, and though Ilya's cynical manner is so different from his own, their disagreements do nothing to mar their friendship and mutual respect. As a new success is obtained, Dmitriy is again exposed to radiation. He persuades Ilya to keep the accident a secret until the experiments are completed. Lyolya, misunderstanding Dmitriy's remoteness, feels that she has failed as a wife. Dmitriy's health deteriorates, and, aware of his doom, he makes a visit to his family. At a Moscow clinic he asks doctors to perform an experimental bone marrow transplant with little chance of success. Ilya comes to visit him on the day before the operation and tells him that their experiments produced a new type of radiation which was not thermonuclear, as anticipated, but nonetheless would be an important contribution to science.

Romero’s DAWN OF THE DEAD. We first follow a group of tense, shifty adolescents as they prowl the streets and subways of Paris, learning through a series of mesmerizingly choreographed set pieces that they’re already well underway with a bombing plot. And then the film becomes something altogether different as these subversives tuck away inside a shopping mall and lose themselves in a consumerist wonderland of clothes, television, toys, and brilliantly deployed pop songs.

The Atacama is also a place where the harsh heat of the sun keeps human remains intact, including those of political prisoners “disappeared” by the Chilean army after the 1973 military coup. Just as astronomers search for distant galaxies, surviving relatives of the disappeared search for the remains of their loved ones in a quest to reclaim their families’ histories.

La notte,Michelangelo Antonioni,Italy,1961,2.03,"This psychologically acute, visually striking modernist work was director Michelangelo Antonioni’s follow-up to the epochal L’AVVENTURA. Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau star as a novelist and his frustrated wife, who, over the course of one night, confront their alienation from each other and the achingly empty bourgeois Milan circles in which they travel.

French New Wave icon Michel Piccoli is a mysterious aging impresario named Simon Cinéma who has hired a young film student, Camille (Julie Gayet), to simply sit with him at his mansion and talk about movies. Skeptical yet increasingly enchanted, Camille bears witness to cinema itself coming to life, allowing Varda to wittily integrate a mind-boggling parade of appearances by screen legends (Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anouk Aimée, Robert De Niro, and many others), and attest to the vigorous health of the movies at the close of the twentieth century.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/one-hundred-and-one-nights

The film follows a young literature student (Betty Schneider) who befriends the members of a loose-knit group of twentysomethings in Paris, united by the apparent suicide of an acquaintance.

Le petit soldat,Jean-Luc Godard,France,1963,1.47,"Before his convention-shattering debut, BREATHLESS, had even premiered, Jean-Luc Godard leapt into the making of his second feature, a thriller that would tackle the most controversial subject in France: the use of torture in the Algerian War. Despite his lack of political convictions, photojournalist Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor) is roped into a paramilitary group waging a shadow war in Geneva against the Algerian independence movement. Anna Karina (in her first collaboration with Godard, whose camera is visibly besotted with her) is beguiling as the mysterious woman with whom Forestier becomes infatuated. Banned for two and a half years by French censors for its depiction of brutal tactics on the part of the French government and the Algerian fighters alike, LE PETIT SOLDAT finds the young Godard already retooling cinema as a vehicle for existential inquiry, political argument, and ephemeral portraiture—in other words, as a medium for delivering “truth twenty-four times per second.”",https://www.criterionchannel.com/le-petit-soldat

The Piano Teacher,Michael Haneke,France,2001,2.18,"In this riveting study of the dynamics of control, Academy Award–winning director Michael Haneke takes on Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek’s controversial 1983 novel about perverse female sexuality and the world of classical music. Haneke finds his match in Isabelle Huppert, who delivers an icy but quietly seething performance as Erika, a piano professor at a Viennese conservatory who lives with her mother in a claustrophobically codepen­dent relation­ship. Severely repressed, she satisfies her mas­ochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life. A critical breakthrough for Haneke, THE PIANO TEACHER—which won the Grand Prix as well as dual acting awards for its stars at Cannes—is a formalist masterwork that remains a shocking sensation.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-piano-teacher

Based on an acclaimed 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK is set at the turn of the twentieth century and concerns a small group of students from an all-female college who vanish, along with a chaperone, while on a St. Valentine’s Day outing. Less a mystery than a journey into the mystic, as well as an inquiry into issues of class and sexual repression in Australian society, Weir’s gorgeous, disquieting film is a work of poetic horror whose secrets haunt viewers to this day.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/picnic-at-hanging-rock
Pigs and Battleships,Shohei Imamura,Japan,1962,1.8,"A dazzling, unruly portrait of postwar Japan, PIGS AND BATTLESHIPS details, with escalating absurdity, the desperate power struggles between small-time gangsters in the port town of Yokosuka.

Pina,Wim Wenders,Germany,2011,1.72,"The boundless imagination and physical marvels of the work of the German modern-dance pioneer Pina Bausch leap off the screen in this exuberant tribute by Wim Wenders. A long-planned film collaboration between the director and the choreographer was in preproduction when Bausch died in 2009. Two years later, Wenders decided to go ahead with the project, reconceiving it as an homage to his late friend. The result, shot in stunning 3D, is a remarkable visual experience and a vivid representation of Bausch’s art, enacted by a group of staggeringly talented dancers from her company, the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch.

Pixote,Héctor Babenco,Brazil,1980,2.12,"With its bracing blend of unflinching realism and aching humanity, Héctor Babenco’s electrifying look at lost youth fighting to survive on the bottom rung of Brazilian society helped put the country’s cinema on the international map. Shot with documentary-like immediacy on the streets of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, PIXOTE follows the eponymous preteen runaway (the heartbreaking Fernando Ramos da Silva, whose own too-short life tragically mirrored that of his character) as he escapes a nightmarish juvenile detention center only to descend into a life of increasingly violent crime alongside a makeshift family of fellow outcasts. Balancing its shocking brutality with moments of tenderness, this stunning journey through Brazil’s underworld is an unforgettable cry from the lower depths that has influenced multiple generations of filmmakers, including Spike Lee, Harmony Korine, and the Safdie brothers.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/pixote

Made up of mesmerizing scenes of Russell and his band performing, both in concert and in the studio, as well as off-the-cuff moments behind the scenes, this singular film—which also features performances by Willie Nelson and George Jones—has attained legendary status over the years.

La Pointe Courte,Agnès Varda,France,1955,1.35,"The great Agnès Varda’s film career began with this graceful, penetrating study of a marriage on the rocks, set against the backdrop of a small Mediterranean fishing village. Both a stylized depiction of the complicated relationship between a married couple (played by Silvia Monfort and Philippe Noiret) and a documentary-like look at the daily struggles of the locals, Varda’s discursive, gorgeously filmed debut was radical enough to later be considered one of the progenitors of the coming French New Wave.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-pointe-courte

With Guitry’s witty dialogue and fleet pacing, this black comedy is the quintessential depiction of a marriage gone sour: after thirty years together, a village gardener (Simon) and his wife (Germaine Reuver) find themselves contemplating how to do away with each other, with the former even planning how he’ll negotiate his eventual criminal trial. Inspired by Guitry’s own post–World War II tangle with the law—a wrongful charge of collaborationism—LA POISON is a blithely caustic broadside against the French legal system and a society all too eager to capitalize on the misfortunes of others.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-poison

Boasting epic explosions, an awesomely 1980s electro soundtrack, and a showstopping finale—which turns an abandoned warehouse into a life-size pinball machine of cascading oil drums, collapsing scaffolds, and shooting fireworks—POLICE STORY 2 confirmed Chan’s status as a performer of unparalleled grace and daring.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/police-story-2

They are an aid to a repressed society, and he uses the money to support his landlady, Haru, and her family. From time to time, Haru shares her bed with Subu, though she believes her dead husband, reincarnated as a carp, disapproves. Director Shohei Imamura has always delighted in the kinky exploits of lowlifes, and in this 1966 classic, he finds subversive humor in the bizarre dynamics of Haru, her Oedipal son, and her daughter, the true object of her pornographer-boyfriend’s obsession.

Real Life,Albert Brooks,United States,1979,1.63,"In his directorial debut, Albert Brooks offers a bitingly satirical and remarkably prescient vision of the rise of reality television. He plays an ambitious director who moves his entire crew in with a “typical” American family in order to make a documentary about their “real life”—but before filming even begins, the project starts to go spectacularly awry. One of the first major mockumentaries ever made, REAL LIFE is a prophetic look at media spectacle and manipulation that introduced the world to Brooks’s one-of-a-kind comic sensibility.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/real-life
Rebels of the Neon God,Tsai Ming-liang,Taiwan,1992,1.78,"Tsai Ming-liang’s debut feature heralded the arrival of one of contemporary cinema’s most acclaimed and idiosyncratic auteurs.

Red Desert,Michelangelo Antonioni,Italy,1964,1.95,"Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1960s panoramas of contemporary alienation were decade-defining artistic events, and RED DESERT, his first color film, is perhaps his most epochal. This provocative look at the spiritual desolation of the technological age—about a disaffected woman, brilliantly portrayed by Antonioni muse Monica Vitti, wandering through a bleak industrial landscape beset by power plants and environmental toxins, and tentatively flirting with her husband’s coworker, played by Richard Harris—continues to keep viewers spellbound. With one startling, painterly composition after another—of abandoned fishing cottages, electrical towers, looming docked ships—RED DESERT creates a nearly apocalyptic image of its time, and confirms Antonioni as cinema’s preeminent poet of the modern age.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/red-desert

When not pasting up self-promotional flyers or hanging at the Peppermint Lounge, she’s getting involved with Paul (Brad Rinn), the nicest guy to ever live in a van next to the highway, and Eric (Richard Hell), an aloof rocker. Shot on 16 mm film that captures the grit and glam of downtown in the 1980s, with an alternately moody and frenetic soundtrack by the Feelies and others, SMITHEREENS—the first American independent film to compete for the Palme d’Or—is an unfaded snapshot of a bygone era.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/smithereens

When the document’s nefarious writings start leading to terrifying parallels in reality, it’s up to Berlin’s star detective, Inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke, reprising his role from M) to connect the most fragmented, maddening clues in a case unlike any other. A sequel to his enormously successful silent film DR. MABUSE: THE GAMBLER, Fritz Lang’s THE TESTAMENT OF DR. MABUSE reunites the director with the character that had effectively launched his career. Lang put slogans and ideas expounded by the Nazis into the mouth of a madman, warning his audience of an imminent menace, which was soon to become a reality.

Trafic,Jacques Tati,France,1971,1.62,"In Jacques Tati’s TRAFIC, the bumbling Monsieur Hulot, kitted out as always with tan raincoat, beaten brown hat, and umbrella, takes to Paris’s highways and byways. In this, his final outing, Hulot is employed as an auto company’s director of design, and accompanies his new product (a “camping car” outfitted with absurd gadgetry) to an auto show in Amsterdam. Naturally, the road there is paved with modern-age mishaps. This late-career delight is a masterful demonstration of the comic genius’s expert timing and sidesplitting knack for visual gags, and a bemused last look at technology run amok.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/trafic

The Tree of Wooden Clogs,Ermanno Olmi,Italy,1978,3.12,"A painterly and sensual immersion in late nineteenth-century Italian farm life, Ermanno Olmi’s THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS lovingly focuses on four families working for one landowner on an isolated estate in the province of Bergamo. Filming on an abandoned farm for four months, Olmi adapted neorealist techniques to tell his story, enlisting local people to live as their own ancestors had, speaking in their native dialect on locations with which they were intimately familiar. Through the cycle of seasons, of backbreaking labor, love and marriage, birth and death, faith and superstition, Olmi naturalistically evokes an existence very close to nature, celebrating its beauty, humor, and simplicity but also acknowledging the feudal cruelty that governs it. Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1978, THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS is intimate in scale but epic in scope, a towering, heart-stirring work of humanist filmmaking.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-tree-of-wooden-clogs

Set amid a soot-choked Pennsylvania landscape, and shot in an intensely intimate vérité style, the film takes up with distant and soft-spoken Wanda (Loden), who has left her husband, lost custody of her children, and now finds herself alone, drifting between dingy bars and motels, where she falls prey to a series of callous men—including a bank robber who ropes her into his next criminal scheme.

For this thrilling, behind-closed-doors account of that campaign, renowned cinema verité filmmakers Chris Hegedus and D. A.

As drug-cartel violence and fearmongering politics intrude on the community, though, the border hardens and disrupts local ways of life.

It was Oscar Micheaux’s second film (after 1919’s THE HOMESTEADER, now lost), centering on an idealistic young woman named Sylvia Landry (Evelyn Preer, one of the first great stars of the race film) who attempts to raise money for an elementary school for black children. In the course of navigating the racial politics of both the black and white communities, Sylvia’s past is revealed in a series of flashbacks that contain the film’s most notorious sequence: the lynching of her parents by a white mob. Micheaux’s staging of the scene is startling in its bluntness and speaks volumes about the director’s fearlessness and willingness to address taboo subject matter. The film touches upon other themes that would recur throughout the controversial filmmaker’s career, such as the promise of rural life vs. the corrupting influence of the city, and the use of religion as a means of misleading the black community.",https://www.criterionchannel.com/within-our-gates
