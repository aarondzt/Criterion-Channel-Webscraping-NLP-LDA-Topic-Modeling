2 or 3 Things I Know About Her,Jean-Luc Godard,France,1967,1960s,1:27,"In 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER (2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D’ELLE), Jean-Luc Godard beckons us ever closer, whispering in our ears as narrator. About what? Money, sex, fashion, the city, love, language, war: in a word, everything. Among the legendary French filmmaker’s finest achievements, the film takes as its ostensible subject the daily life of Juliette Janson (Marina Vlady), a housewife from the Paris suburbs who prostitutes herself for extra money. Yet this is only a template for Godard to spin off into provocative philosophical tangents and gorgeous images. 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER is perhaps Godard’s most revelatory look at consumer culture, shot in ravishing widescreen color by Raoul Coutard.",1.45,https://www.criterionchannel.com/2-or-3-things-i-know-about-her
3 Faces,Jafar Panahi,Iran,2018,2010s,1:40,"Iranian master Jafar Panahi’s fourth feature since he was officially banned from filmmaking is a courageous act of antipatriarchal defiance from an artist who has refused to be silenced. This playful docufiction road movie begins with a smartphone video sent to the director and real-life star actress Behnaz Jafari from a desperate young woman who, distraught at her family’s refusal to let her study drama, seemingly records her own suicide. Traveling to the woman’s rural hometown to investigate, Panahi and Jafari find themselves launched on a slyly comic, quietly revelatory journey that builds in narrative, thematic, and visual intricacy to put forth a grand expression of community and solidarity under the eye of oppression.",1.67,https://www.criterionchannel.com/3-faces
"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",Cristian Mungiu,Romania,2007,2000s,1:53,"Romanian filmmaker Cristian Mungiu shot to international prominence with this rigorously realistic Palme d’Or–winning second feature. In 1987, during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu, college roommates Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) and Găbița (Laura Vasiliu) seek an illegal abortion for Găbița. In unflinching but empathetic detail, the film recounts the events of twenty-four perilous hours in their lives, culminating in their encounter with a manipulative and menacing abortionist (Vlad Ivanov). With powerful performances that accentuate the characters’ flawed humanity, 4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS is a gutting account of the impossible choices women face when taking control of their bodies means breaking the law.",1.88,https://www.criterionchannel.com/4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days
"The VI Olympic Winter Games, Oslo 1952",Tankred Ibsen,Norway,1952,1950s,1:43,"Director Tancred Ibsen's penchant for depicting rustic life shines through in the bucolic scenes at the start of THE VI OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES, OSLO 1952. In addition to the exciting scenes of competition (Winter sports are followed with almost rabid fervor in Scandinavia), Ibsen records a sense of community spirit shared among the competitors.",1.72,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-vi-olympic-winter-games-oslo-1952
8½,Federico Fellini,Italy,1963,1960s,2:19,"Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, a director whose new project is collapsing around him, along with his life. One of the greatest films about film ever made, Federico Fellini’s 8½ (Otto e mezzo) turns one man’s artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema. An early working title for 8½ was THE BEAUTIFUL CONFUSION, and Fellini’s masterpiece is exactly that: a shimmering dream, a circus, and a magic act.",2.32,https://www.criterionchannel.com/81-2
The IX Olympiad at Amsterdam,,Netherlands,1928,1920s,4:11,"Made by Istituto Luce, the Italian film company controlled by Benito Mussolini since 1925, THE IX OLYMPIAD IN AMSTERDAM may, understandably, highlight Italian participants, but it is the first Olympic documentary that describes the techniques of certain events with useful particulars.",4.18,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-ix-olympiad-in-amsterdam

13 Days in France,François Reichenbach…,France,1968,1960s,1:52,"13 DAYS IN FRANCE, a personal project for French filmmaker Claude Lelouch, approaches the X Olympic Winter Games in a radical way, ignoring certain disciplines and dwelling on others. This impressionistic kaleidoscope of a movie manages to be both freewheeling and intimate. Under the direction of Lelouch and François Reichenbach, 13 DAYS IN FRANCE pulses with the insouciant spirit of the sixties and the carefree cinematography and editing pioneered by the French New Wave.",1.87,https://www.criterionchannel.com/13-days-in-france
XIVth Olympiad: The Glory of Sport,Castleton Knight,United Kingdom,1948,1940s,2:18,"The official film of the Games of the XIV Olympiad London 1948 is the first in color and seeks to comprise both the winter and summer events from that year.

16 Days of Glory,Bud Greenspan,United States,1986,1980s,4:44,"Director Bud Greenspan, whose career covering sporting events had begun some twenty years earlier, seized the opportunity to helm the official film of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics with such gusto that he would become the IOC's go-to person for Olympic movies. And this 284-minute record of the 1984 Games set the tone for his nine Olympic films to come. 16 DAYS OF GLORY is audacious and fresh and springs from a fascination with the energy and ambition that drive the finest athletes.",4.73,https://www.criterionchannel.com/16-days-of-glory

24 Frames,Abbas Kiarostami,Iran,2017,2010s,1:53,"For what would prove to be his final film, Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami gave himself a challenge: to create a dialogue between his work as a filmmaker and his work as a photographer, bridging the two art forms to which he had dedicated his life. Setting out to reconstruct the moments immediately before and after a photograph is taken, Kiarostami selected twenty-four still images—most of them stark landscapes inhabited only by foraging birds and other wildlife—and digitally animated each one into its own subtly evolving four-and-a-half-minute vignette, creating a series of poignant studies in movement, perception, and time. A sustained meditation on the process of image making, 24 FRAMES is a graceful and elegiac farewell from one of the giants of world cinema.",1.88,https://www.criterionchannel.com/24-frames

Sumptuously filmed by cinematographer Agnès Godard and featuring an evocative score by Tindersticks, 35 SHOTS OF RUM pays homage to the cinema of Yasujiro Ozu while finding a rhythm that’s entirely its own, casting a lovely spell unlike any other movie you’ve seen.",1.67,https://www.criterionchannel.com/35-shots-of-rum
The 39 Steps,Alfred Hitchcock,United Kingdom,1935,1930s,1:27,"A heart-racing spy story by Alfred Hitchcock, THE 39 STEPS follows Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) as he stumbles upon a conspiracy that thrusts him into a hectic chase across the Scottish moors—a chase in which he is both the pursuer and the pursued—as well as into an unexpected romance with the cool Pamela (Madeline Carroll). Adapted from a novel by John Buchan, this classic wrong-man thriller from the Master of Suspense anticipates the director’s most famous works (especially NORTH BY NORTHWEST), and remains one of his cleverest and most entertaining films.",1.45,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-39-steps
45 Years,Andrew Haigh,United Kingdom,2015,2010s,1:35,"In this exquisitely calibrated film, Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay perform a subtly off-kilter pas de deux as Kate and Geoff, an English couple who, on the eve of an anniversary celebration, find their long marriage shaken by the arrival of a letter to Geoff that unceremoniously collapses his past into their shared present. Director Andrew Haigh carries the tradition of British realist cinema to artful new heights in 45 YEARS, weaving the momentous into the mundane as the pair go about their daily lives, while the evocatively flat, wintry Norfolk landscape frames their struggle to maintain an increasingly untenable status quo. Loosely adapting a short story by David Constantine, Haigh shifts the focus from the slightly erratic Geoff to Kate, eliciting a remarkable, nuanced portrayal by Rampling of a woman’s gradual metamorphosis from unflappable wife to woman undone.",1.58,https://www.criterionchannel.com/45-years

49th Parallel,Michael Powell,United Kingdom,1941,1940s,2:02,"At once a compelling piece of anti-isolationist propaganda and a quick-witted wartime thriller, 49TH PARALLEL is a classic early work from the inimitable British filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. When a Nazi U-boat crew, headed by the ruthless Eric Portman, is stranded in Canada during the thick of World War II, the men evade capture by hiding out in a series of rural communities, before trying to cross the border into the still-neutral United States. Both soul-stirring and delightfully entertaining, 49TH PARALLEL features a colorful cast of characters played by larger-than-life actors Laurence Olivier, Raymond Massey, Anton Walbrook, and Leslie Howard.",2.03,https://www.criterionchannel.com/49th-parallel
The 400 Blows,François Truffaut,France,1959,1950s,1:40,"François Truffaut’s first feature is also his most personal. Told through the eyes of Truffaut’s cinematic counterpart, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), THE 400 BLOWS sensitively re-creates the trials of Truffaut’s own childhood, unsentimentally portraying aloof parents, oppressive teachers, and petty crime. The film marked Truffaut’s passage from leading critic to trailblazing auteur of the French New Wave.",1.67,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-400-blows

Fifteen-year-old Tahir (Ahidjo Mahamat Moussa) and his eight-year-old brother Amine (Hamza Moctar Aguid) wake up one morning to find that their father has left home. Skipping school, the two embark on a journey through their village in hopes of finding the man who walked out on them, unable to accept that he’s gone.

Isabelle Huppert stars as Maud, a strong-willed filmmaker whose world is turned upside down when she suffers a stroke. Bedridden but determined to pursue her latest film project, she sees Vilko (Kool Shen), a con man who swindles celebrities, on a TV talk show.

Accident,Joseph Losey,United Kingdom,1967,1960s,1:46,"Mysterious, subversive, and endlessly fascinating, ACCIDENT is a tantalizing modernist puzzle from director Joseph Losey and writer Harold Pinter.

An Actor’s Revenge,Kon Ichikawa,Japan,1963,1960s,1:53,"A uniquely prolific and chameleonic figure of world cinema, Kon Ichikawa delivered a burst of stylistic bravado with this intricate tale of betrayal and retribution. Set in the cloistered world of nineteenth-century kabuki theater, the film charts a female impersonator’s attempts to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were driven to insanity and suicide by a trio of corrupt men. Ichikawa takes the conventions of melodrama and turns them on their head, bringing the hero’s fractured psyche to life in boldly experimental widescreen compositions infused with kaleidoscopic color, pop-art influences, and meticulous choreography. Anchored by a magnificently androgynous performance by Kazuo Hasegawa, reprising a role he had played on-screen three decades earlier, AN ACTOR’S REVENGE is an eye-popping examination of how the illusions of art intersect with life.",1.88,https://www.criterionchannel.com/an-actor-s-revenge

After the Rehearsal,Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1984,1980s,1:13,"With this spare chamber piece, set in an empty theater, Ingmar Bergman returned to his perennial theme of the permeability of life and art. Lingering after a rehearsal for August Strindberg’s “A Dream Play” (a touchstone for the filmmaker throughout his career), eminent director Henrik (Erland Josephson) enters into a frank and flirtatious conversation with his up-and-coming star, Anna (Lena Olin), leading him to recall his affair with Anna’s late mother, the self-destructive actress Rakel (Ingrid Thulin).

Ain’t Them Bodies Saints,David Lowery,United States,2013,2010s,1:36,"Brought to life with exquisite detail and rich cinematography by Bradford Young, the gritty landscape of 1970s Texas Hill Country is the backdrop for this mood-drenched collision of love and crime. After his pregnant wife (Rooney Mara) makes one false move during a bloody shootout, a bank robber (Casey Affleck) faces a twenty-five-year sentence that destroys his dreams of family life. Shot through with the yearning and melancholy of a folk ballad, David Lowery’s directorial breakthrough breathes new life into the outlaw-romance genre as it ruminates rapturously on the fragility and transience of love.",1.6,https://www.criterionchannel.com/ain-t-them-bodies-saints
¡Alambrista!,Robert M. Young,United States,1977,1970s,1:36,"In ¡ALAMBRISTA!, a Mexican farmworker sneaks across the border to California to make money to send to his family back home. It is a story that happens every day, told here in an uncompromising, groundbreaking work of realism from American independent filmmaker Robert M. Young. Vivid and spare where other films about illegal immigration might sentimentalize, Young’s take is equal parts intimate character study and gripping road movie, a political work that never loses sight of the complex man at its center. ¡ALAMBRISTA!, winner of the Cannes Film Festival’s inaugural Caméra d'Or in 1978, remains one of the best films ever made on this perennially relevant topic.",1.6,https://www.criterionchannel.com/alambrista
Alexander Nevsky,Sergei Eisenstein,Soviet Union,1938,1930s,1:48,"Eisenstein drew on history, Russian folk narratives, and the techniques of Walt Disney to create this broadly painted epic of Russian resilience. This story of Teutonic knights vanquished by Prince Alexander Nevsky’s tactical brilliance resonated deeply with a Soviet Union concerned with the rise of Nazi Germany. Widely imitated, most notably by Laurence Olivier’s Battle of Agincourt re-creation for HENRY V, the Battle on the Ice scene remains one of the most famous audio-visual experiments in film history, perfectly blending action with the rousing score of Sergei Prokofiev.",1.8,https://www.criterionchannel.com/alexander-nevsky
Alice in the Cities,Wim Wenders,Germany,1974,1970s,1:53,"The first of the road films that would come to define the career of Wim Wenders, the magnificent ALICE IN THE CITIES is an emotionally generous and luminously shot odyssey. A German journalist (Rüdiger Vogler) is driving across the United States to research an article; it’s a disappointing trip, in which he is unable to truly connect with what he sees. Things change, however, when he has no choice but to take a young girl named Alice (Yella Rottländer) with him on his return trip to Germany, after her mother (Lisa Kreuzer)—whom he has just met—leaves the child in his care.

A lonely widow (Brigitte Mira) meets a much younger Arab worker (El Hedi ben Salem) in a bar during a rainstorm. They fall in love, to their own surprise—and to the outright shock of their families, colleagues, and drinking buddies.

All Monsters Attack,Ishiro Honda,Japan,1969,1960s,1:09,"Director Ishiro Honda returned again for the first Godzilla movie expressly for children. Economizing by reusing effects shots from other films in the series, All Monster Attack tells the story of Ichiro, a lonely latchkey kid who finds solace in his dreams of befriending Minilla, the titular progeny of Son of Godzilla, whose parent is also often absent.

Lyrical in its feeling for landscape but biting in its social and political commentary, ALL MY GOOD COUNTRYMEN stands as the defining work by one of the lesser-known figures of the Czechoslovak New Wave.",2.0,https://www.criterionchannel.com/all-my-good-countrymen

When the workers at Hormel Foods in Austin, Minnesota, saw their wages and benefits drastically cut, they organized a strike that would stretch on for over a year of grueling negotiations, hardball tactics, and devastating setbacks.

The American Friend,Wim Wenders,Germany,1977,1970s,2:07,"Wim Wenders pays loving homage to rough-and-tumble Hollywood film noir with THE AMERICAN FRIEND, a loose adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel “Ripley’s Game.” Dennis Hopper oozes quirky menace as an amoral American art dealer who entangles a terminally ill German everyman, played by Bruno Ganz, in a seedy criminal underworld as revenge for a personal slight, but when the two become embroiled in an ever-deepening murder plot, they form an unlikely bond. Filmed on location in Hamburg and Paris, with some scenes shot in grimy, late-seventies New York City, Wenders’ international breakout is a stripped-down crime story that mixes West German and American film flavors, and it features cameos by filmmakers Jean Eustache, Samuel Fuller, and Nicholas Ray.",2.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-american-friend
The American Soldier,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1970,1970s,1:20,"The German-born American GI Ricky (Karl Scheydt) returns to Munich from Vietnam and is promptly hired as a contract killer.

Le amiche,Michelangelo Antonioni,Italy,1955,1950s,1:45,"This major early achievement by Michelangelo Antonioni bears the first signs of the cinema-changing style for which he would soon be world-famous. LE AMICHE (THE GIRLFRIENDS) is a brilliantly observed, fragmentary depiction of modern bourgeois life, conveyed from the perspective of five Turinese women. As four of the friends try to make sense of the suicide attempt of the fifth, they find themselves examining their own troubled romantic lives. With suggestions of the theme of modern alienation and the fastidious visual abstraction that would define his later masterpieces such as L’AVVENTURA, L’ECLISSE, and RED DESERT, Antonioni’s film is a devastating take on doomed love and fraught friendship.",1.75,https://www.criterionchannel.com/le-amiche

And God Created Woman,Roger Vadim,France,1956,1950s,1:31,"The astounding success of Roger Vadim’s AND GOD CREATED WOMAN revolutionized the foreign film market and turned Brigitte Bardot into an international star.

Andrei Rublev,Andrei Tarkovsky,Soviet Union,1966,1960s,3:03,"Tracing the life of a renowned icon painter, the second feature by Andrei Tarkovsky vividly conjures the murky world of medieval Russia. This dreamlike and remarkably tactile film follows Andrei Rublev as he passes through a series of poetically linked scenes—snow falls inside an unfinished church, naked pagans stream through a thicket during a torchlit ritual, a boy oversees the clearing away of muddy earth for the forging of a gigantic bell—gradually emerging as a man struggling mightily to preserve his creative and religious integrity. Appearing here in the director’s preferred 183-minute cut as well as the version that was originally suppressed by Soviet authorities, the masterwork ANDREI RUBLEV is one of Tarkovsky’s most revered films, an arresting meditation on art, faith, and endurance.",3.05,https://www.criterionchannel.com/andrei-rublev
Androcles and the Lion,Chester Erskine,United Kingdom,1952,1950s,1:38,"George Bernard Shaw's breezy, delightful dramatization of this classic fable, about a Christian slave who pulls a thorn from a lion's paw and is spared from death in the Colosseum as a result of his kind act, was written as a meditation on modern Christian values. And Pascal's final Shaw production plays it broadly, casting comic character actor Alan Young as the titular naïf.

Three actors in turn take on the lead role (including Kerry Fox in a marvelous performance as the adult Frame), as the film describes a journey from an impoverished childhood marked by tragedy to a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia resulting in electroshock therapy and a narrowly escaped lobotomy to, finally, international literary fame. Unobtrusively capturing the beauty and power of the New Zealand landscape while maintaining the film’s focus on the figure at its center, Campion broke new ground for female filmmakers everywhere and earned a sweep of her country’s film awards, along with the Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival.",2.63,https://www.criterionchannel.com/an-angel-at-my-table

Anne-Marie,Raymond Bernard,France,1936,1930s,1:38,"Raymond Bernard's Anne-Marie was a special movie on several counts -- as a feature film from the 1930's about a young woman who aspires to become a pilot, and as the next-to-last pre-war French film by the star Annabella before she left went to Hollywood. But its special status resides in its screenplay, the sole work in that writing genre by renowned aviator/author Antoine de Saint-Exupery (1900-1944), whose credits also included The Little Prince.",1.63,https://www.criterionchannel.com/anne-marie
Antichrist,Lars von Trier,Denmark,2009,2000s,1:48,"Lars von Trier shook up the film world when he premiered ANTICHRIST at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. In this graphic psychodrama, a grief-stricken man and woman—a searing Willem Dafoe and Cannes best actress winner Charlotte Gainsbourg—retreat to their cabin deep in the woods after the accidental death of their infant son, only to find terror and violence at the hands of nature and, ultimately, each other. But this most confrontational work yet from one of contemporary cinema’s most controversial artists is no mere provocation. It is a visually sublime, emotionally ravaging journey to the darkest corners of the possessed human mind; a disturbing battle of the sexes that pits rational psychology against age-old superstition; and a profoundly effective horror film.",1.8,https://www.criterionchannel.com/antichrist
Antonio Gaudí,Hiroshi Teshigahara,Japan,1984,1980s,1:12,"Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) designed some of the world’s most astonishing buildings, interiors, and parks; Japanese director Hiroshi Teshigahara constructed some of the most aesthetically audacious films ever made. In ANTONIO GAUDÍ, their artistry melds in a unique, enthralling cinematic experience. Less a documentary than a visual poem, Teshigahara’s film takes viewers on a tour of Gaudí’s truly spectacular architecture, including his massive, still-unfinished master­piece, the Sagrada Família basilica in Barcelona. With camera work as bold and sensual as the curves of his subject’s organic structures, Teshigahara immortalizes Gaudí on film.",1.2,https://www.criterionchannel.com/antonio-gaudi
Any Number Can Win,Henri Verneuil,France,1962,1960s,2:01,"This ice-cool crime caper bridges two generations of French cinema by bringing together longtime national screen icon Jean Gabin with hotshot rising star Alain Delon. Gabin is the career ex-con determined to pull off one last heist before he retires. Delon is the petty thief he enlists to help him rob a Cannes casino. They’ve got a seemingly perfect plan, until . . . Veteran director Henri Verneuil lends his craftsman’s touch to this jazz-inflected noir that rivals the thrillers of Jean-Pierre Melville for expertly deployed tension.",2.02,https://www.criterionchannel.com/any-number-can-win

APARAJITO picks up where the first film leaves off, with Apu and his family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy city of Varanasi (then known as Benares). As Apu progresses from wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager, eventually studying in Kolkata, we witness his academic and moral education, as well as the growing complexity of his relationship with his mother.

This extraordinary final chapter brings our protagonist’s journey full circle. Apu is now in his early twenties, out of college, and hoping to live as a writer. Alongside his professional ambitions, the film charts his romantic awakening, which occurs as the result of a most unlikely turn of events, and his eventual, fraught fatherhood. Featuring soon to be Ray regulars Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in star-making performances, and demonstrating Ray’s ever more impressive skills as a crafter of pure cinematic imagery, APUR SANSAR is a moving conclusion to this monumental trilogy.",1.77,https://www.criterionchannel.com/apur-sansar
The Arbor,Clio Barnard,United Kingdom,2010,2010s,1:34,"One of the most formally inventive, fascinating, and radical films in recent memory, Clio Barnard’s electrifying debut feature combines documentary, performance, and fiction as actors lip sync to recorded interviews to tell the harrowing life story of Andrea Dunbar, the brilliant but deeply troubled British playwright who won acclaim for works like “The Arbor” and “Rita, Sue and Bob Too.” Tracing her dark upbringing in the notorious Buttershaw estate in Bradford, her turbulent relationship with her family, and her tragic death at the age of twenty-nine, THE ARBOR is both a thrillingly innovative work of creative nonfiction and a deeply affecting account of a brief but remarkable life.",1.57,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-arbor

Transposing a Tolstoy novella to contemporary Paris, L’ARGENT follows a counterfeit bill as it originates as a prop in a schoolboy prank, then circulates like a virus among the corrupt and the virtuous alike before landing with a young truck driver and leading him to incarceration and violence. With brutal economy, Bresson constructs his unforgiving vision of original sin out of starkly perceived details, rooting his characters in a dehumanizing material world that withholds any hope of transcendence.",1.4,https://www.criterionchannel.com/l-argent
Ariel,Aki Kaurismäki,Finland,1988,1980s,1:12,"In Kaurismäki's drolly existential crime drama, a coal miner named Taisto (Turo Pajala) attempts to leave behind a provincial life of inertia and economic despair, only to get into ever deeper trouble. Yet a minor-key romance with a hilariously dispassionate meter maid (Susanna Haavisto) might provide a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. Ariel, which boasts a terrific soundtrack of Finnish tango and Baltic pop music and lovely cinematography by Kaurismäki's longtime cameraman Timo Salmimen, put its director on the international map.",1.2,https://www.criterionchannel.com/ariel

Each part is as technically impressive as it is riotous: a man attempts to read a novel about vampires beside his sleeping wife but cannot seem to separate reality from fiction; a simple afternoon at the movies becomes a consumer-culture assault; a jarringly noisy urban landscape keeps a city’s population on edge; and a day in the country means something different to a picnicking city couple, a hunter, and a farmer.",1.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/as-long-as-you-ve-got-your-health

Shot in the island’s pastoral countryside, AUGUST AT AKIKO'S is a quiet film filled with deep undercurrents of history and mythology.

Balthazar, whose life parallels that of his first keeper, Marie, is truly a beast of burden, suffering the sins of humankind. But despite his powerlessness, he accepts his fate nobly. Through Bresson’s unconventional approach to composition, sound, and narrative, this simple story becomes a moving parable about purity and transcendence.",1.58,https://www.criterionchannel.com/au-hasard-balthazar

Baal,Volker Schlöndorff,West Germany,1970,1970s,1:24,"Volker Schlöndorff transported Bertolt Brecht's 1918 debut play to contemporary West Germany for this vicious experiment in adaptation, seldom seen for nearly half a century. Oozing with brutish charisma, Rainer Werner Fassbinder embodies the eponymous anarchist poet, who feels that bourgeois society has rejected him and sets off on a schnapps-soaked rampage. Hewing faithfully to Brecht's text, Schlöndorff juxtaposes the theatricality of the prose with bare-bones, handheld 16 mm camera work, which gives immediacy to this savage story of rebellion. Featuring a supporting cast drawn from Fassbinder's troupe of theater actors that also includes Margarethe von Trotta, BAAL demonstrates the uncompromising vision of its director, a trailblazer of the New German Cinema.",1.4,https://www.criterionchannel.com/baal

An ominous force is converging on Bacurau, an unknown threat that will force the community to band together and fight for its survival.

His impressionistic take on the notorious Charles Starkweather killing spree of the late 1950s uses a serial-killer narrative as a springboard for an oblique teenage romance, lovingly and idiosyncratically enacted by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. The film introduced many of the elements that would earn Malick his passionate following: the enigmatic approach to narrative and character, the unusual use of voice-over, the juxtaposition of human violence with natural beauty, the poetic investigation of American dreams and nightmares. This debut has spawned countless imitations, but none have equaled its strange sublimity.",1.57,https://www.criterionchannel.com/badlands

Marrying the director’s abiding concern for the experiences of ordinary people with an understated but superbly judged visual style, THE BAKER’S WIFE is at once wonderfully droll and piercingly perceptive in its depiction of the complexities of human relationships.",2.23,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-baker-s-wife

The white network executives love it, and so do audiences, forcing Pierre and his collaborators to confront their public’s insatiable appetite for dehumanizing stereotypes. Shot primarily on unvarnished digital video and boasting spot-on performances from Wayans, Savion Glover, Jada Pinkett Smith, Tommy Davidson, Michael Rapaport, Mos Def, and Paul Mooney, Bamboozled is a stinging indictment of mass entertainment at the turn of the twenty-first century that looks more damning with each passing year.",2.25,https://www.criterionchannel.com/bamboozled

Band of Outsiders,Jean-Luc Godard,France,1964,1960s,1:35,"Four years after BREATHLESS, Jean-Luc Godard reimagined the gangster film even more radically with BAND OF OUTSIDERS. In it, two restless young men (Sami Frey and Claude Brasseur) enlist the object of both of their fancies (Anna Karina) to help them commit a robbery—in her own home. This audacious and wildly entertaining French New Wave gem is at once sentimental and insouciant, effervescently romantic and melancholy, and it features some of Godard’s most memorable set pieces, including the headlong race through the Louvre and the unshakably cool Madison dance sequence.",1.58,https://www.criterionchannel.com/band-of-outsiders
Barbarella,Roger Vadim,France,1968,1960s,1:38,"This outrageous blend of science fiction, high camp, and erotic fantasia made Jane Fonda a permanent cult icon. She is sensational as a wide-eyed space adventurer whose quest to track down a famed scientist takes her to the Tau Ceti galaxy, where she encounters an array of perilously kinky pleasures. Described by director Roger Vadim as “a kind of sexual ‘Alice in Wonderland’ of the future,” BARBARELLA has taken its place as a midnight-movie classic thanks to its trippy art direction and sense of kitschy comic-book fun.",1.63,https://www.criterionchannel.com/barbarella

As violence escalates on both sides, children shoot soldiers at point-blank range, women plant bombs in cafés, and French soldiers resort to torture to break the will of the insurgents. Shot on the streets of Algiers in documentary style, the film is a case study in modern warfare, with its terrorist attacks and the brutal techniques used to combat them.

If we opened me up, we’d find beaches.” Originally intended to be Agnès Varda’s farewell to filmmaking, this enchanting auto-portrait, made in her eightieth year, is a freewheeling journey through her life, career, and artistic philosophy. Revisiting the places that shaped her—from the North Sea beaches of Belgium where she spent her childhood to the Mediterranean village where she shot her first film to the boardwalks of Los Angeles where she lived with her husband, Jacques Demy—Varda reflects on a lifetime of creation and inspiration, successes and setbacks, heartbreak and joy. Replete with images of wonder and whimsy—the ocean reflected in a kaleidoscope of mirrors, the streets of Paris transformed into a sandy beach, the filmmaker herself ensconced in the belly of a whale—The Beaches of Agnès is a playful and poignant record of a life lived fully and passionately in the name of cinema.",1.87,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-beaches-of-agnes

A romantic drama, it put him back in the success column as a filmmaker, working in the popular realm of his mentor Keisuke Kinoshita, but now without the input of the latter or his relatives; and it also brought Kobayashi together with screenwriter Zenzo Matsuyama, with whom he would enjoy a rich creative partnership (culminating with THE HUMAN CONDITION I, II, and III) over the next few years, as he developed his own style and reputation within the studio system.",2.0,https://www.criterionchannel.com/beautiful-days

Amid the azure waters and sunbaked desert landscapes of Djibouti, a French Foreign Legion sergeant (Denis Lavant) sows the seeds of his own ruin as his obsession with a striking young recruit (Grégoire Colin) plays out to the thunderous, operatic strains of Benjamin Britten.

Made during the strife of the war-torn Balkan states in the nineties, this gripping triptych of love and violence is also a timeless evocation of the loss of pastoral innocence, and remains one of recent cinema’s most powerful laments on the futility of war.",1.88,https://www.criterionchannel.com/before-the-rain

This surreal and erotic late-sixties daydream from provocateur for the ages Luis Buñuel is an examination of desire and fetishistic pleasure (its characters’ and its viewers’), as well as a gently absurdist take on contemporary social mores and class divisions.

At the offices of a Boston independent newspaper, the staff members—including music critic Max (Jeff Goldblum, in one of his first leading roles), news reporter Harry (John Heard) and photographer Abbie (Lindsay Crouse)—enjoy a positive and open-minded work environment.

A geologist (Godfrey Cambridge) unwittingly brings home an unusual frozen piece of debris from the North Pole. But when it thaws, the hungrier-than-ever Blob comes to life again, consuming nearly everyone in its path and terrorizing the town. No one is safe as it crawls into a bowling alley, oozes its way across an ice rink, and becomes grotesquely bloated with the blood of its victims. Can this viscous villain ever be stopped? TV legend Larry Hagman helmed this cult classic, the only feature film he ever directed; upon its 1980s rerelease, the movie was tagged “The Film that J. R.

Beyond the Hills,Cristian Mungiu,Romania,2012,2010s,2:32,"With this arresting drama based on notorious real-life events, Cristian Mungiu mounts a complex inquiry into faith, fanaticism, and indifference. At a desolate Romanian monastery, a young novice nun, Voichita (Cosmina Stratan), reunites with her former companion Alina (Cristina Flutur), who plans to take her to Germany. But Voichita proves unwilling to abandon her calling, and Alina becomes increasingly desperate to reclaim her devotion, putting the outsider at odds with the monastery's ascetic priest, and precipitating a painfully misguided, brutal attempt to save her soul. A naturalistic tragedy with the dark force of a folktale, anchored by the fraught dynamic between cinema newcomers Flutur and Stratan (who shared the best actress prize at Cannes), BEYOND THE HILLS bears powerful witness to individuals at cross-purposes and institutions ill-equipped to help those most in need.",2.53,https://www.criterionchannel.com/beyond-the-hills

Director Oscar Micheaux himself was a former homesteader, and strongly believed that African Americans should establish rural communities rather than follow the urban migration. But it's hard to resist the allure of the city when Micheaux allows energetic singers and dancers to take the nightclub stage for extended musical numbers. The restoration of BIRTHRIGHT was derived from the only known surviving 35 mm print, which is missing the first two of its nine reels - approximately twenty minutes of material.

The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,West Germany,1972,1970s,2:04,"In the early 1970s, Rainer Werner Fassbinder discovered the American melodramas of Douglas Sirk and was inspired by them to begin working in a new, more intensely emotional register. One of the first and best-loved films of this period in his career is THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT, which balances a realistic depiction of tormented romance with staging that remains true to the director’s roots in experimental theater. This unforgettable, unforgiving dissection of the imbalanced relationship between a haughty fashion designer (Margit Carstensen) and a beautiful but icy ingenue (Hanna Schygulla)—based, in a sly gender reversal, on the writer-director’s own desperate obsession with a young actor—is a true Fassbinder affair, featuring exquisitely claustrophobic cinematography by Michael Ballhaus and full-throttle performances by an all-female cast.",2.07,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-bitter-tears-of-petra-von-kant

White Americans have always stereotyped African Americans. But the rigid definitions of “Blackness” that African Americans impose on each other, Riggs asserts, have also been devastating. Using his grandmother’s gumbo as a metaphor for the rich diversity of Black identities, Riggs traverses the country, bringing us face-to-face with Black folks young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban, gay and straight, grappling with the paradox of numerous, often contested definitions of Blackness.

Bless Their Little Hearts,Billy Woodberry,United States,1984,1980s,1:25,"Scripted and shot by Charles Burnett, Billy Woodberry’s slice-of-life revelation is a key masterpiece of the LA Rebellion, the black independent-cinema renaissance that emerged from UCLA’s film school in the 1970s and ’80s. BLESS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS distills the social concerns and neorealist aesthetics of the movement into a sensitive exploration of the inner workings of community and family that pays homage to the power of the blues. Searching for steady work, Charlie Banks (Nate Hardman) views his chronic unemployment as a kind of spiritual trial. But day work and selling a few catfish can’t sustain a family of five. While his wife Andais (a remarkable Kaycee Moore) works to support them with dignity, Charlie finds comfort for his wounded sense of manhood in an affair that threatens his marriage and family.",1.42,https://www.criterionchannel.com/bless-their-little-hearts
Blind Chance,Krzysztof Kieślowski,Poland,1981,1980s,2:03,"Before he stunned the cinematic world with the epic series DEKALOG and the THREE COLORS trilogy, the great Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski made his first work of metaphysical genius, BLIND CHANCE, a compelling drama about the difficulty of reconciling political ideals with personal happiness. This unforgettable film follows Witek (the magnetic Bogusław Linda), a medical student with an uncertain future in Communist Poland; Kieślowski dramatizes Witek’s journey as a series of different possibilities, suggesting that chance rules our lives as much as choice does. First suppressed and then censored by the Polish government, BLIND CHANCE is here presented in its complete original form.",2.05,https://www.criterionchannel.com/blind-chance
Blithe Spirit,David Lean,United Kingdom,1945,1940s,1:36,"BLITHE SPIRIT, David Lean’s delightful film version of Noël Coward’s theater sensation (onstage, it broke London box-office records before hitting Broadway), stars Rex Harrison as a novelist who cheekily invites a medium (Margaret Rutherford) to his house to conduct a séance, hoping the experience will inspire a book he’s working on. Things go decidedly not as planned when she summons the spirit of his dead first wife (Kay Hammond), a severe inconvenience for his current one (Constance Cummings). Employing Oscar-winning special effects to spruce up Coward’s theatrical farce, BLITHE SPIRIT is a sprightly supernatural comedy with winning performances.",1.6,https://www.criterionchannel.com/blithe-spirit
The Blob,Irvin S. Yeaworth Jr.,United States,1958,1950s,1:22,"A cult classic of gooey greatness, THE BLOB follows the havoc wreaked on a small town by an outer-space monster with neither soul nor vertebrae, with Steve McQueen playing the rebel teen who tries to warn the residents about the jellylike invader. Strong performances and ingenious special effects help THE BLOB transcend the schlock sci-fi and youth delinquency genres from which it originates. Made outside of Hollywood by a maverick film distributor and a crew whose credits mostly comprised religious and educational shorts, THE BLOB helped launch the careers of McQueen and composer Burt Bacharach, whose bouncy title song is just one of this film’s many unexpected pleasures.",1.37,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-blob
Blonde Venus,Josef von Sternberg,United States,1932,1930s,1:34,"Josef von Sternberg returned Marlene Dietrich to the stage in BLONDE VENUS, both a glittering spectacle and a sweeping melodrama about motherly devotion. Unfolding episodically, the film tells the story of Helen (Dietrich), once a German chanteuse, now an American housewife, who resurrects her stage career after her husband (Herbert Marshall) falls ill; she then becomes the mistress of a millionaire (Cary Grant), in a slide from loving martyr to dishonored woman. Despite production difficulties courtesy of the Hays Office, the director’s baroque visual style shines, as do one of the most memorable musical numbers in all of cinema and a parade of visionary costumes by von Sternberg and Dietrich’s longtime collaborator Travis Banton.",1.57,https://www.criterionchannel.com/blonde-venus
Blood Simple,Joel Coen,United States,1984,1980s,1:35,"Joel and Ethan Coen’s career-long darkly comic road trip through misfit America began with this razor-sharp, hard-boiled neonoir set somewhere in Texas, where a sleazy bar owner releases a torrent of violence with one murderous thought. Actor M. Emmet Walsh looms over the proceedings as a slippery private eye with a yellow suit, a cowboy hat, and no moral compass, and Frances McDormand’s cunning debut performance set her on the road to stardom. The tight scripting and inventive style that have marked the Coens’ work for decades are all here in their first film, in which cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld abandons black-and-white chiaroscuro for neon signs and jukebox colors that combine with Carter Burwell’s haunting score to lurid and thrilling effect. Blending elements from pulp fiction and low-budget horror flicks, BLOOD SIMPLE reinvented the film noir for a new generation, marking the arrival of a filmmaking ensemble that would transform the American independent cinema scene.",1.58,https://www.criterionchannel.com/blood-simple

Emil Jannings, the quintessential German-expressionist actor, stars as Professor Rath, the sexually repressed instructor of a boys’ prep school.

Through striking storybook visuals, Breillat spins the tale of Marie-Catherine (Lola Créton), who is forced into becoming the young bride of an aristocratic ogre (Dominique Thomas) with a notorious reputation for murdering his wives. As she navigates her new life in Bluebeard’s castle—and wonders what’s behind the mysterious locked door she has been forbidden from entering—Marie-Catherine must employ all her cunning to outwit her husband and escape the most unpleasant of fates.",1.37,https://www.criterionchannel.com/bluebeard-1

Invited to document the progress of postwar Vietnamese society, a Japanese photojournalist (George Lam) initially finds a picture-perfect image of communist contentment. But when he begins looking beneath the idealized surface the government wants him to see, he discovers a world of poverty and brutality that shocks him into helping a desperate family escape.

Mainstream avenues were limited, however, and his first films were made on the peripheries of the film business.

Born in Flames,Lizzie Borden,United States,1983,1980s,1:20,"The film that rocked the foundations of the 1980s underground, this postpunk provocation is a DIY fantasia of female rebellion set in America ten years after a social-democratic cultural revolution. When Adelaide Norris (Jean Satterfield), the black revolutionary founder of the Woman’s Army, is mysteriously killed, a diverse coalition of women—across all lines of race, class, and sexual orientation—emerges to blow the system apart.

The Lestingois family decides to take in the irrepressible bum, and he shows his gratitude by shaking the household to its foundations.

Boy,Nagisa Oshima,Japan,1969,1960s,1:37,"Toshio, a 10-year-old boy, lives with his father, a shiftless ex-soldier, his stepmother, and his toddler half brother. The family gains a livelihood by means of a swindle in which Toshio's stepmother rushes into the path of oncoming traffic and feigns being struck by a car in order to hound a quick cash ""settlement"" from the driver. Eventually, Toshio is trained to assume her function, and the family moves from city to city to avoid detection. Their nomadic lifestyle isolates Toshio, who often retreats into fantasies. He attempts to run away to his grandmother's house in Kochio, but, unable to afford the fare, he buys a ticket to a less distant location and after sleeping on a beach returns to his parents. With police now alerted to the family's activities, they travel north to snowy Hokkaido. The boy's parents quarrel: his stepmother hopes to gather enough money in a short time to make a better life for them, while his father believes that they should refrain from repeating the swindle until the danger has passed. They discuss separating for a time and argue over who will take Toshio, the breadwinner. The father, in an outburst, flings away the watch Toshio's stepmother has given him. The toddler wanders into the road to retrieve it and causes an accident that results in the deaths of a man and a little girl. Later, the despondent Toshio builds a snowman and tells his little brother of a benevolent man from outer space who will right all wrongs; then, recognizing his own impotence, he attacks the snowman. The family settles down and again moves south, but the police arrest them.

Alighting not on milestones but on the small, in-between moments that make up lives, Linklater fashions a flawlessly acted, often funny portrait that flows effortlessly from one year to the next.

But Film Is My Mistress,Stig Björkman,Sweden,2010,2010s,1:06,"Director Stig Björkman creates a portrait of Ingmar Bergman through behind-the-scenes footage collected over a forty year period, as well as a testament to Bergman's lasting influence through interviews with directors Woody Allen, Olivier Assayas, Martin Scorsese, and others.",1.1,https://www.criterionchannel.com/but-film-is-my-mistress
Butley,Harold Pinter,United Kingdom,1974,1970s,2:10,"On any given day, Ben Butley, a self-made train wreck of an English Literature professor, can shrug off everyone and everything with ease. But today, the disaster of Butley’s misspent life threatens to dwarf even his cynical non-expectations. Arriving at his cramped office, Butley is informed that his adored Joey is moving in with another man, his estranged wife is remarrying, and his seemingly untalented colleague has been published ahead of him. As embodied by Alan Bates, Butley falls back on the surgically precise wit and savage eloquence that helped put him in his current circumstances. The blitzkrieg of vitriolic commentary with which Butley engages lovers, students, rivals, and allies becomes a glass-bottom boat illuminating the churning depths of his bankrupted soul. Harold Pinter, in his directorial debut, turns author Simon Gray’s single-set, dialogue-driven play into a dynamic visual experience that tracks Bates’s hilarious and fearless performance with cunning precision.",2.17,https://www.criterionchannel.com/butley
Caesar and Cleopatra,Gabriel Pascal,United Kingdom,1945,1940s,2:08,"Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains pop off the screen in vivid Technicolor in Gabriel Pascal's version of Shaw's 1901 play about love and politics in ancient Rome and Egypt.

Though on the surface a relatively straightforward romantic comedy (all the better to fool the censors), CALAMITY is consistently subversive in its ironic commentary on the bureaucratic failings of Czech society.",1.67,https://www.criterionchannel.com/calamity
Calcutta,Louis Malle,France,1969,1960s,1:39,"When he was cutting Phantom India, Louis Malle found that the footage shot in Calcutta was so diverse, intense, and unforgettable that it deserved its own film.

The Cameraman,Edward Sedgwick,United States,1928,1920s,1:10,"Buster Keaton is at the peak of his slapstick powers in THE CAMERAMAN—the first film that the silent-screen legend made after signing with MGM, and his last great masterpiece. The final work over which he maintained creative control, this clever farce is the culmination of an extraordinary, decade-long run that produced some of the most innovative and enduring comedies of all time. Keaton plays a hapless newsreel cameraman desperate to impress both his new employer and his winsome office crush as he zigzags up and down Manhattan hustling for a scoop. Along the way, he goes for a swim (and winds up soaked), becomes embroiled in a Chinatown Tong War, and teams up with a memorable monkey sidekick (the famous Josephine). The marvelously inventive film-within-a-film setup allows Keaton’s imagination to run wild, yielding both sly insights into the travails of moviemaking and an emotional payoff of disarming poignancy.",1.17,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-cameraman

Through a series of episodic juxtapositions, Johnson explores the relationships between image makers and their subjects, the tension between the objectivity and intervention of the camera, and the complex interaction of unfiltered reality with crafted narrative. A work that combines documentary, autobiography, and ethical inquiry, CAMERAPERSON is a moving glimpse into one filmmaker’s personal journey and a thoughtful examination of what it means to train a camera on the world.",1.7,https://www.criterionchannel.com/cameraperson

Jenkins and crafted by an entirely African American cast and crew, this luminous, recently rediscovered landmark of American independent cinema is a charmingly laid-back, socially incisive love story set in the heart of Louisiana. It’s there that a forbidden romance between an aspiring writer (Richard Romain) and an ambitious, college-bound woman (Tommye Myrick) lays bare the tensions between two black communities: the wealthy Creoles and the working-class descendants of slaves.

Director Felipe Cazals adopts a gritty documentary style to narrate the events in CANOA while referencing the climate of political repression that would lead to the massacre of student protesters in Mexico City shortly thereafter. The resulting film is a daring commentary on ideological manipulation, religious fanaticism, and mass violence, as well as a visceral expression of horror.",1.92,https://www.criterionchannel.com/canoa-a-shameful-memory
A Canterbury Tale,Michael Powell…,United Kingdom,1944,1940s,2:05,"Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s beloved classic A CANTERBURY TALE is a profoundly personal journey to Powell’s bucolic birthplace of Kent, England. Set amid the tumult of the Second World War, yet with a rhythm as delicate as a lullaby, the film follows three modern-day incarnations of Chaucer’s pilgrims—a melancholy “landgirl,” a plainspoken American GI, and a resourceful British sergeant—who are waylaid in the English countryside en route to the mythical town and forced to solve a bizarre village crime. Building to a majestic climax that ranks as one of the filmmaking duo’s finest achievements, the dazzling A CANTERBURY TALE has acquired a following of devotees passionate enough to qualify as pilgrims themselves.",2.08,https://www.criterionchannel.com/a-canterbury-tale

Careful,Guy Maddin,Canada,1992,1990s,1:39,"With striking cinematography reminiscent of early two-strip Technicolor, Guy Maddin crafts a visually dazzling, dreamlike parody of 1920s mountain melodramas that doubles as an outré, quasi-Freudian parable of sexual repression. “Be careful.” “Never hold a baby’s face near an open pin.” “Never gamble with life.” These are the bizarre warnings that the residents of the Alpine village of Tolzbad live by. Most importantly, they must never utter loud sounds lest they cause an avalanche. Sound is not the only thing that must be suppressed, however. For Tolzbad is a hotbed of frustrated desires, Oedipal angst, and sibling rivalry.

En route, she is haunted by a bizarre apparition that compels her toward an abandoned lakeside pavilion. Made by industrial filmmakers on a small budget, the eerily effective B-movie classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS was intended to have “the look of a Bergman and the feel of a Cocteau”—and, with its strikingly used locations and spooky organ score, it succeeds.

Marie Losier captures the moving, humorous, and always colorful dualities of this legendary figure. Cassandro’s story—of an underdog and a queer icon—unfolds on both sides of the Mexican-American border.

Scott plays white knight to his boss’s suffering wife (Michèle Morgan), stealing her away to Cuba. But when she is fatally stabbed in a crowded nightclub, Scott is accused of murder and must flee through the shadowy streets of Havana in a reckless attempt to prove his innocence.

Daring in its refusal to make the socialist leader into an easy martyr or hero, CHE paints a vivid, naturalistic portrait of the man himself (Benicio Del Toro, in a stunning, Cannes-award-winning performance), from his overthrow of the Batista dictatorship to his 1964 United Nations trip to the end of his short life.

Michel Simon cuts a tragic figure as an unhappily married cashier and amateur painter who becomes so smitten with a prostitute that he refuses to see the obvious: that she and her pimp boyfriend are taking advantage of him.

The Children Are Watching Us,Vittorio De Sica,Italy,1944,1940s,1:24,"A very early Vittorio de Sica effort, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US was originally released in Italy as I BAMBINI CI GUARDANO.

The film, a morbid melodrama, concerns a young mother who can’t stand the pressures exerted on her by family responsibilities. She deserts her husband and her brood, causing destruction to rain upon them all. Avoiding the rococo gestures and dramatic overstatement that might have attended this film had it been made in Hollywood, De Sica fashions a subtle tale about real people caught up in a real situation. De Sica’s sensitivity towards the younger cast members of THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US would manifest itself in many of his formative films, notably SCIUSCIA and THE BICYCLE THIEF.

Children of Paradise,Marcel Carné,France,1945,1940s,3:10,"Poetic realism reached sublime heights with CHILDREN OF PARADISE, widely considered one of the greatest French films of all time. This nimble depiction of nineteenth-century Paris’s theatrical demimonde, filmed during World War II, follows a mysterious woman (Arletty) loved by four different men (all based on historical figures): an actor, a criminal, a count, and, most poignantly, a mime (Jean-Louis Barrault, in a longing-suffused performance for the ages). With sensitivity and dramatic élan, director Marcel Carné and screenwriter Jacques Prévert resurrect a world teeming with hucksters and aristocrats, thieves and courtesans, pimps and seers.

Chimes at Midnight,Orson Welles,Spain,1966,1960s,1:56,"The crowning achievement of Orson Welles’s extraordinary cinematic career, CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT was the culmination of the filmmaker’s lifelong obsession with Shakespeare’s ultimate rapscallion, Sir John Falstaff. Usually a comic supporting figure, Falstaff—the loyal, often soused friend of King Henry IV’s wayward son Prince Hal—here becomes the focus: a robustly funny and ultimately tragic screen antihero played by Welles with looming, lumbering grace. Integrating elements from both “Henry IV” plays as well as “Richard II,” “Henry V,” and “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” Welles created a gritty and unorthodox Shakespeare film as a lament, he said, “for the death of Merrie England.” Poetic, philosophical, and visceral—with a kinetic centerpiece battle sequence that rivals anything in the director’s body of work—CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT is as monumental as the figure at its heart.",1.93,https://www.criterionchannel.com/chimes-at-midnight
The China Syndrome,James Bridges,United States,1979,1970s,2:02,"Released less than two weeks before the reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island, this gripping, eerily prophetic thriller sketches a terrifying portrait of the risks of nuclear power. While researching a story on alternative energy, ambitious television reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman (Michael Douglas) witness an unnerving control-room accident at a Southern California power plant. As the plant’s officials move to cover up the truth about what happened, it’s left to a crusading Kimberly and veteran engineer Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) to try to stop an impending disaster.",2.03,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-china-syndrome

Chocolat,Claire Denis,France,1988,1980s,1:44,"Claire Denis drew on her own childhood experiences growing up in colonial French Africa for her multilayered, languorously absorbing feature debut, which explores many of the themes that would recur throughout her work. Returning to the town where she grew up in Cameroon after many years living in France, a white woman (Mireille Perrier) reflects on her relationship with Protée (Isaach De Bankolé), a Black servant with whom she formed a friendship while not fully grasping the racial divides that governed their worlds.",1.73,https://www.criterionchannel.com/chocolat
Christine,Antonio Campos,United Kingdom,2016,2010s,1:59,"Rebecca Hall delivers an astonishing performance in this emotionally gripping look at the life of Christine Chubbuck, the Florida news anchor who, in 1974, made headlines with a shocking act that would go down in television infamy. With powerful empathy, CHRISTINE charts Chubbuck’s journey toward that fateful moment as she finds herself caught in the midst of personal and professional crises at a Sarasota news station where her brand of social-justice-oriented reporting seems to have no place. Between unrequited love, frustration at work, a tumultuous home, and self-doubt, Christine begins to spiral down a dark path.",1.98,https://www.criterionchannel.com/christine
Christmas in July,Preston Sturges,United States,1940,1940s,1:07,"“If you can’t sleep at night, it isn’t the coffee, it’s the bunk!” That’s the slogan that ambitious office clerk Jimmy MacDonald (Dick Powell) enters in hopes of winning the $25,000 grand prize in a contest sponsored by Maxford House Coffee. When Jimmy’s mischievous coworkers trick him into thinking he’s won, the young man’s newfound “success” goes to his head with madcap consequences. Adapted from the writer-director’s own stage play “A Cup of Coffee,” Preston Sturges’s sophomore feature takes aim at the pitfalls of capitalism with riotous screwball glee.",1.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/christmas-in-july
A Christmas Tale,Arnaud Desplechin,France,2008,2000s,2:32,"In Arnaud Desplechin’s beguiling A CHRISTMAS TALE (UN CONTE DE NOËL), Catherine Deneuve brings her legendary poise to the role of Junon, matriarch of the troubled Vuillard family, who come together at Christmas after she learns she needs a bone marrow transplant from a blood relative. That simple family reunion setup, however, can’t begin to describe the unpredictable, emotionally volatile experience of this film, an inventive, magical drama that’s equal parts merriment and melancholy. Unrequited childhood loves and blinding grudges, brutal outbursts and sudden slapstick, music, movies, and poetry, A CHRISTMAS TALE ties it all together in a marvelously messy package.",2.53,https://www.criterionchannel.com/a-christmas-tale
Chronicle of a Summer,Jean Rouch…,France,1961,1960s,1:30,"Few films can claim as much influence on the course of cinema history as CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER. The fascinating result of a collaboration between filmmaker-anthropologist Jean Rouch and sociologist Edgar Morin, this vanguard work of what Morin termed cinéma- vérité is a brilliantly conceived and realized sociopolitical diagnosis of the early sixties in France. Simply by interviewing a group of Paris residents in the summer of 1960—beginning with the provocative and eternal question “Are you happy?” and expanding to political issues, including the ongoing Algerian War—Rouch and Morin reveal the hopes and dreams of a wide array of people, from artists to factory workers, from an Italian émigré to an African student. CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER’s penetrative approach gives us a document of a time and place with extraordinary emotional depth.",1.5,https://www.criterionchannel.com/chronicle-of-a-summer
Chungking Express,Wong Kar Wai,Hong Kong,1994,1990s,1:43,"The whiplash, double-pronged CHUNGKING EXPRESS is one of the defining works of nineties cinema and the film that made Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai an instant icon. Two heartsick Hong Kong cops (Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony Leung), both jilted by ex-lovers, cross paths at the Midnight Express take-out restaurant stand, where the ethereal pixie waitress Faye (Faye Wong) works. Anything goes in Wong’s gloriously shot and utterly unexpected charmer, which cemented the sex appeal of its gorgeous stars and forever turned canned pineapple and the Mamas and the Papas’ “California Dreamin’” into tokens of romantic longing.",1.72,https://www.criterionchannel.com/chungking-express
Le ciel est à vous,Jean Grémillon,France,1944,1940s,1:47,"In this uplifting romantic drama, the wife of a mechanic and former fighter pilot falls in love with the idea of flying herself. This soon becomes an obsession, and she undertakes a lofty feat: the longest solo flight ever made by a woman.

La Ciénaga,Lucrecia Martel,Argentina,2001,2000s,1:40,"The release of Lucrecia Martel’s LA CIÉNAGA heralded the arrival of an astonishingly vital and original voice in Argentine cinema. With a radical and disturbing take on narrative, beautiful cinematography, and a highly sophisticated use of on- and offscreen sound, Martel turns her tale of a dissolute bourgeois extended family, whiling away the hours of one sweaty, sticky summer, into a cinematic marvel. This visceral take on class, nature, sexuality, and the ways that political turmoil and social stagnation can manifest in human relationships is a drama of extraordinary tactility, and one of the great contemporary film debuts.",1.67,https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-cienaga
The Circus,Charles Chaplin,United States,1928,1920s,1:12,"In the last film he made during the silent era, Charlie Chaplin revels in the art of the circus, paying tribute to the acrobats and pantomimists who inspired his virtuoso pratfalls. After being mistaken for a pickpocket, Chaplin’s Tramp flees into the ring of a traveling circus and soon becomes the star of the show, falling for the troupe’s bareback rider along the way. Despite its famously troubled production, this gag-packed comedy ranks among Chaplin’s finest, thanks to some of the most audacious set pieces of the director-performer’s career, including a close brush with a lion and a climactic tightrope walk with a barrelful of monkeys. THE CIRCUS, which was rereleased in 1969 with a new score by Chaplin, is an uproarious high-wire act that showcases silent cinema’s most popular entertainer at the peak of his comic powers.",1.2,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-circus
City Lights,Charles Chaplin,United States,1931,1930s,1:26,"CITY LIGHTS, the most cherished film by Charlie Chaplin, is also his ultimate Little Tramp chronicle. The writer-director-star achieved new levels of grace, in both physical comedy and dramatic poignancy, with this silent tale of a lovable vagrant falling for a young blind woman who sells flowers on the street (a magical Virginia Cherrill) and mistakes him for a millionaire. Though this Depression-era smash was made after the advent of sound, Chaplin remained steadfast in his love for the expressive beauty of the pre-talkie form. The result was the epitome of his art and the crowning achievement of silent comedy.",1.43,https://www.criterionchannel.com/city-lights
City of Women,Federico Fellini,Italy,1980,1980s,2:19,"Federico Fellini’s epic 1980 fantasia introduced the start of the maestro’s delirious late period. Overflowing with sensory (and sensual) invention, CITY OF WOMEN taps into the era’s restless youth culture to become nothing less than Fellini’s postpunk opus. Marcello Mastroianni appears as the director’s alter ego in a quasi reprise of his character from 8½. As though passing into a dream, this charismatic avatar finds himself initiated into a phantasmagoric world where women—or an idea of women—have taken power, navigating an array of psychosexual set pieces that culminate in a bravura hot-air-balloon climax.",2.32,https://www.criterionchannel.com/city-of-women
Claire’s Knee,Eric Rohmer,France,1970,1970s,1:46,"“Why would I tie myself to one woman?” asks Jerôme in CLAIRE’S KNEE, though he plans to marry a diplomat’s daughter by summer’s end. He spends his July at a lakeside boardinghouse, nursing crushes on the sixteen-year-old Laura and, more tantalizingly, her long-legged, blonde, older half sister, Claire. Baring her knee on a ladder under a blooming cherry tree, Claire unwittingly incites a moral crisis for Jerôme while creating an image that is both the iconic emblem of Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales and one of French cinema’s most enduring moments.",1.77,https://www.criterionchannel.com/claire-s-knee
"Clean, Shaven",Lodge Kerrigan,United States,1994,1990s,1:19,"Lodge Kerrigan began his succession of utterly unique, visually and aurally dazzling character studies with the raw, ravaging CLEAN, SHAVEN. A compelling headfirst dive into the mindscape of a schizophrenic (played by the remarkable Peter Greene) as he tries to track down his daughter after he is released from an institution, Kerrigan’s film brilliantly uses sound and image to lead audiences into a terrifying subjectivity.

As the investigation proceeds, Michel befriends the police inspector (Jean Rochefort) in charge of his son’s case. Based on a novel by Georges Simenon, Tavernier’s masterful feature debut eschews the expected narrative machinations of a procedural to focus instead on the relationship that develops between the two men as Michel attempts to understand the motivations behind his son’s crime.",1.75,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-clockmaker-of-st-paul

This fiction-documentary hybrid uses a sensational real-life event—the arrest of a young man on charges that he fraudulently impersonated the well-known filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf—as the basis for a stunning, multilayered investigation into movies, identity, artistic creation, and existence, in which the real people from the case play themselves.

The Cloud-Capped Star,Ritwik Ghatak,India,1960,1960s,2:07,"Directed by the visionary Bengali filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak, THE CLOUD-CAPPED STAR tells the story of a family who have been uprooted by the Partition of India and come to depend on their eldest daughter, the self-sacrificing Neeta (Supriya Choudhury). She watches helplessly as her own hopes and desires are pushed aside time and again by those of her siblings and parents, until all her chances for happiness evaporate, leaving her crushed and ailing. Experimenting with off-balance compositions, discontinuous editing, and a densely layered soundtrack, Ghatak devised an intellectually ambitious and emotionally devastating new shape for the melodrama, lamenting the tragedies of Indian history and the inequities of traditional gender roles while blazing a formal trail for the generations of Indian filmmakers who have followed him.",2.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-cloud-capped-star
Clouds of Sils Maria,Olivier Assayas,France,2014,2010s,2:03,"This multilayered, immensely entertaining drama from the great contemporary French director Olivier Assayas is a singular look at the intersection of high art and popular culture. The always extraordinary Juliette Binoche is stirring as Maria, a stage and screen icon who is being courted to star in a new production of the play that made her famous—only this time she must assume the role of the older woman. Kristen Stewart matches her punch for punch as her beleaguered assistant, called upon to provide support both professional and emotional for her mercurial boss. And Chloë Grace Moretz is Maria’s callow new castmate, a starlet waiting in the wings. An amorphous, soul-searching tale, filled with ethereal images of its Swiss Alps setting, CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA brilliantly dramatizes one woman’s reckoning with herself and the world.",2.05,https://www.criterionchannel.com/clouds-of-sils-maria
Code Unknown,Michael Haneke,France,2000,2000s,1:57,"One of the world’s most influential and provocative filmmakers, the Oscar–winning Austrian director Michael Haneke diagnoses the social maladies of contemporary Europe with devastating precision and artistry. His drama CODE UNKNOWN, the first of his many films made in France, may be his most inspired work. Composed almost entirely of brilliantly shot, single-take vignettes focusing on characters connected to one seemingly minor incident on a Paris street, Haneke’s film—with an outstanding international cast headlined by Juliette Binoche—is a revelatory examination of racial inequality and the failure of communication in an increasingly diverse modern landscape.",1.95,https://www.criterionchannel.com/code-unknown

Cold Water,Olivier Assayas,France,1994,1990s,1:35,"An acclaimed early work by Olivier Assayas, the long-unavailable, deeply felt coming-of-age drama COLD WATER can at last be seen in the United States. Drawing from his own youthful experiences, Assayas revisits the outskirts of Paris in the early 1970s, telling the story of teenage lovers Gilles (Cyprien Fouquet) and Christine (Virginie Ledoyen), whose rebellions against family and society threaten to tear them apart. The visceral realism of the movie’s narrative and the near experimentalism of its camera work come together effortlessly thanks in part to a rock soundtrack that vividly evokes the period. COLD WATER, whose centerpiece is one of the most memorable party sequences ever committed to film, is a heartbreaking immersion in the emotional tumult of being young.",1.58,https://www.criterionchannel.com/cold-water
La collectionneuse,Eric Rohmer,France,1967,1960s,1:26,"A bombastic, womanizing art dealer and his painter friend go to a seventeenth-century villa on the Riviera for a relaxing summer getaway. But their idyll is disturbed by the presence of the bohemian Haydée, accused of being a “collector” of men. Eric Rohmer’s first color film, LA COLLECTIONNEUSE pushes Six Moral Tales into new, darker realms while showcasing the clever, delectably ironic battle-of-the-sexes repartee (in a script written by Rohmer and the three main actors) and effortlessly luscious Nestor Almendros photography that would define the remainder of the series.",1.43,https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-collectionneuse
Color Adjustment,Marlon Riggs,United States,1992,1990s,1:20,"Following his groundbreaking study of anti-Black stereotypes ETHNIC NOTIONS, Marlon Riggs turned his attention to the racial implications of America’s favorite addiction: television watching. COLOR ADJUSTMENT traces forty years of race relations through the lens of prime-time entertainment, scrutinizing television’s racial myths and stereotypes. Narrated by Ruby Dee, this at once engaging and perceptive documentary allows viewers to revisit some of television’s most popular stars and shows—from “Amos ’n’ Andy” to “The Cosby Show”—and their complex, sometimes insidious roles in shaping America’s racial narrative.",1.33,https://www.criterionchannel.com/color-adjustment
The Color of Pomegranates,Sergei Parajanov,Soviet Union,1969,1960s,1:20,"A breathtaking fusion of poetry, ethnography, and cinema, Sergei Parajanov’s masterwork overflows with unforgettable images and sounds. In a series of tableaux that blend the tactile with the abstract, THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES revives the splendors of Armenian culture through the story of the eighteenth-century troubadour Sayat-Nova, charting his intellectual, artistic, and spiritual growth through iconographic compositions rather than traditional narrative. The film’s tapestry of folklore and metaphor departed from the realism that dominated the Soviet cinema of its era, leading authorities to block its distribution, with rare underground screenings presenting it in a restructured form. This edition features the cut closest to Parajanov’s original vision, in a restoration that brings new life to one of cinema’s most enigmatic meditations on art and beauty.",1.33,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-color-of-pomegranates
Colossal Youth,Pedro Costa,Portugal,2006,2000s,2:36,"Many of the lost souls of OSSOS and In VANDA’S ROOM return in the spectral landscape of COLOSSAL YOUTH, which brings to Pedro Costa’s Fontainhas films a new theatrical, tragic grandeur. This time, Costa focuses on Ventura, an elderly immigrant from Cape Verde living in a low-cost housing complex in Lisbon, who has been abandoned by his wife and spends his days visiting his neighbors, whom he considers his “children.” What results is a form of ghost story, a tale of derelict, dispossessed people living in the past and present at the same time, filmed by Costa with empathy and startling radiance.",2.6,https://www.criterionchannel.com/colossal-youth
A Colt Is My Passport ,Takashi Nomura,Japan,1967,1960s,1:24,"One of Japanese cinema’s supreme emulations of American noir, Takashi Nomura’s A COLT IS MY PASSPORT is a down-and-dirty but gorgeously photographed yakuza film starring Joe Shishido as a hard-boiled hit man caught between rival gangs.

Come and See,Elem Klimov,Soviet Union,1985,1980s,2:23,"This legendary film from Soviet director Elem Klimov is a senses-shattering plunge into the dehumanizing horrors of war. As Nazi forces encroach on his small village in Belorussia, teenage Flyora (Alexei Kravchenko, in a searing depiction of anguish) eagerly joins the Soviet resistance. Rather than the adventure and glory he envisioned, what he finds is a waking nightmare of unimaginable carnage and cruelty—rendered with a feverish, otherworldly intensity by Klimov’s subjective camera work and expressionistic sound design. Nearly blocked from being made by Soviet censors, who took seven years to approve its script, COME AND SEE is perhaps the most visceral, impossible-to-forget antiwar film ever made.",2.38,https://www.criterionchannel.com/come-and-see
The Comedy,Rick Alverson,United States,2012,2010s,1:34,"Never mind the title, this unsparing dissection of privilege and the limits of hipster irony is a modern tragedy. Tim Heidecker gives a fearless performance as Swanson, an aging trust-fund Brooklynite whose sole mode of interacting with the world is a repellently “transgressive” sarcasm—a crudely offensive emotional barrier that he uses to mask his profound alienation. A singularly discomforting experience that never stops pushing the envelope, THE COMEDY is one of the most provocative and polarizing films of the last decade.",1.57,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-comedy

Made during the Nazi Occupation of France, Henri-Georges Clouzot’s LE CORBEAU was attacked by the right-wing Vichy regime, the left-wing Resistance press, and the Catholic Church, and it was banned after the Liberation. But some—including Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre—recognized the powerful subtext to Clouzot’s anti-informant, anti-Gestapo fable, and worked to rehabilitate Clouzot’s directorial reputation after the war. LE CORBEAU brilliantly captures a spirit of paranoid pettiness and self-loathing turning an occupied French town into a twentieth-century Salem.",1.52,https://www.criterionchannel.com/le-corbeau

When he is recruited by the Nazis, Kopfrkingl’s increasingly deranged worldview drives him to formulate his own shocking final solution.

Detour,Edgar G. Ulmer,United States,1945,1940s,1:09,"From Poverty Row came a movie that, perhaps more than any other, epitomizes the dark fatalism at the heart of film noir. As he hitchhikes his way from New York to Los Angeles, a down-on-his-luck nightclub pianist (Tom Neal) finds himself with a dead body on his hands and nowhere to run—a waking nightmare that goes from bad to worse when he picks up the most vicious femme fatale in cinema history, Ann Savage’s snarling, monstrously conniving drifter Vera. Working with no-name stars on a bargain-basement budget, B auteur Edgar G. Ulmer turned threadbare production values and seedy, low-rent atmosphere into indelible pulp poetry.

As the makeshift family embarks on a new life, DHEEPAN settles into an intimate social-realist mode before tightening into a dynamic turf-war thriller, as well as an unsettling study of the psychological aftereffects of combat.

Along with visceral camera work by Jaroslav Kučera and Miroslav Ondříček—two of Czechoslovak cinema’s most influential cinematographers—Němec makes inventive use of fractured editing, elliptical storytelling, and flights of surrealism as he strips context away from this bare-bones tale, evoking the panicked delirium of consciousness lost in night and fog.",1.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/diamonds-of-the-night

In his claustrophobic mod home, he pampers his pill-popping wife, seduces his maid, and uncovers a gun that may have once been owned by John Dillinger—and then things get even stranger.

The Divorce of Lady X,Tim Whelan,United Kingdom,1938,1930s,1:31,"Droll comedy of manners and morals that was based on a play and made as a film once before in 1932 as COUNSEL'S OPINION, directed by Allan Dwan. The four screenwriters' literate script of Biro's adaptation of the stage work takes Oberon to a London hotel where she is attending a costume party. The weather turns foul and she must spend the night at the hostelry with several other ladies who were unable to make it home. Olivier is a young lawyer occupying a suite and the manager prevails on him to give up some of the space in his copious quarters, but Olivier is adamant until Oberon uses her wiles on him. The result is that she gets the comfortable bed and Olivier must snooze on the floor in the next room. In the morning, she leaves before he can find out anything about this fascinating and attractive woman. Her alacrity causes him to wonder if she's married. When he arrives at his office, an old school chum contacts him and wants Olivier to handle his divorce. The man is sure his wife spent the night with another man at the same hotel we've seen earlier. Olivier can't believe this nerd could be married to Oberon. He isn't, of course, and his wife is someone else entirely. But Olivier doesn't know that yet. So it gets down to one of those British drawing-room farces where identities are mistaken, accusations are made, absurd situations occur, and Olivier and Oberon are together at the finale. Richardson is very funny as the man who wants a divorce from wife Barnes, who has been married thrice before and has backhanded fidelity on many other occasions. Oberon shows she can play light comedy as well as some of the heavier work she had to do over the years. The Technicolor tinting was supervised by long-time advisor Natalie Kalmus and, although it lent a nice air to the already-airy material, it was totally unnecessary.",1.52,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-divorce-of-lady-x

The freewheeling watercolor visuals of animators John and Faith Hubley, striking score (featuring Dizzy Gillespie), and voice work from a cast that ranges from the Hubleys’ children to Meryl Streep come together in a ride on the “carousel of life” that’s as much an educational film as it is a one-of-a-kind full-sensory experience.",1.2,https://www.criterionchannel.com/everybody-rides-the-carousel
Every Man for Himself,Jean-Luc Godard,France,1980,1980s,1:28,"After a decade in the wilds of avant-garde and early video experimentation, Jean-Luc Godard returned to commercial cinema with this star-driven work of social commentary, while remaining defiantly intellectual and formally cutting-edge. EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF, featuring a script by Jean-Claude Carrière and Anne-Marie Miéville, looks at the sexual and professional lives of three people, a television director (Jacques Dutronc), his ex-girlfriend (Nathalie Baye), and a prostitute (Isabelle Huppert), to create a meditative story about work, relationships, and the notion of freedom. Made twenty years into his career, it was, Godard said, his “second first film.”",1.47,https://www.criterionchannel.com/every-man-for-himself

The Executioner,Luis García Berlanga,Spain,1963,1960s,1:31,"This masterpiece of black humor, beloved in Spain but too little seen elsewhere, threads a scathing critique of Franco-era values through a macabre farce about an undertaker who marries an executioner's daughter and reluctantly takes over her father's job so the family can keep their government-allotted apartment. As caustic today as it was in 1963, this early collaboration between Luis Garcia Berlanga and his longtime screenwriter Rafael Azcona is an unerring depiction of what Berlanga called ""the invisible traps that society sets up for us."" A furiously funny personal attack on capital punishment, THE EXECUTIONER evaded the state censors who sought to suppress it, and today is regarded as one of the greatest Spanish films of all time.",1.52,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-executioner
Exile,Rithy Panh,France,2016,2010s,1:20,"Rithy Panh’s follow-up to his acclaimed documentary THE MISSING PICTURE continues his powerfully personal inquiry into the Cambodian genocide. Through a poetic mix of archival footage, philosophical voice-over narration, and tableaux enacted in a soundstage recreation of a thatched hut, Panh delves into his own harrowing experiences under the Khmer Rouge. The result is a soul-shaking essay on memory, loss, and resistance in the face of unimaginable terror.",1.33,https://www.criterionchannel.com/exile
The Exile,Oscar Micheaux,United States,1931,1930s,1:18,"THE EXILE is the earliest surviving sound feature by an African American filmmaker.

Swirling around them are Eric (Elias Koteas), the house DJ, who is jealousy possessive of Christina; Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian), the club’s owner, who is pregnant by Eric; and Thomas (Don McKellar), a smuggler of rare bird eggs whose activities Francis is investigating.

Granted unprecedented access to hundreds of sketches, drawings, and paintings by Orson Welles—tantalizing, never-before-seen glimpses into the filmmaker’s rich inner life—Cousins sheds new light on the experiences, dreams, desires, and obsessions that fueled his creativity and inspired his masterpieces. Playful, profound, and as daringly iconoclastic as its subject, THE EYES OF ORSON WELLES is a one-of-a-kind work of visual archaeology, a fresh way of looking at a cinematic giant whose singular worldview—fiercely humanist, defiantly antiauthoritarian—resonates now more urgently than ever.",1.92,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-eyes-of-orson-welles

EYES WITHOUT A FACE, directed by the supremely talented Georges Franju, is rare in horror cinema for its odd mixture of the ghastly and the lyrical, and it has been a major influence on the genre in the decades since its release. There are images here—of terror, of gore, of inexplicable beauty—that once seen are never forgotten.",1.5,https://www.criterionchannel.com/eyes-without-a-face

The Face of Another,Hiroshi Teshigahara,Japan,1966,1960s,2:01,"A staggering work of existential science fiction, THE FACE OF ANOTHER dissects identity with the sure hand of a surgeon. Okuyama (YOJIMBO’s Tatsuya Nakadai), after being burned and disfigured in an industrial accident and estranged from his family and friends, agrees to his psychiatrist’s radical experiment: a face transplant, created from the mold of a stranger. As Okuyama is thus further alienated from the world around him, he finds himself giving in to his darker temptations. With unforgettable imagery, Teshigahara’s film explores both the limits and freedom in acquiring a new persona, and questions the notion of individuality itself.",2.02,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-face-of-another

Ingmar Bergman intended FANNY AND ALEXANDER as his swan song, and it is the legendary director’s warmest and most autobiographical film, a four-time Academy Award-winning triumph that combines his trademark melancholy and emotional intensity with immense joy and sensuality.

After Terr, kept as a pet since infancy, escapes from his gigantic child captor, he is swept up by a band of radical fellow Oms who are resisting the Draags' oppression and violence.

Elena meets Fernando, an Italian law student; he seduces her with promises of love, and the ever watchful Anaïs bears witness to the corruption of her sister’s innocence.

Beginning with portraits of the world-renowned art forger Elmyr de Hory and his equally devious biographer, Clifford Irving, Welles embarks on a dizzying journey that simultaneously exposes and revels in fakery and fakers of all stripes, not the least of whom is Welles himself.

Maurice Ronet (ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS), in an implosive, haunted performance, plays Alain Leroy, a self-destructive writer who resolves to kill himself and spends the next twenty-four hours trying to reconnect with a host of wayward friends.

Secrets and deceptions strain the already tenuous relationship of a childless, middle-aged couple, as the wife’s city-bred sophistication bumps up against the husband’s small-town simplicity, and a generational sea change—in the form of her headstrong, modern niece—sweeps over their household.

Setting his later version in a seaside location, Ozu otherwise preserves the details of his elegantly simple plot wherein an aging actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his former lover and illegitimate son, a scenario that enrages his current mistress and results in heartbreak for all. Together, the films offer a unique glimpse into the evolution of one of cinema’s greatest directors. A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS reveals Ozu in the midst of developing his mode of expression; FLOATING WEEDS reveals his distinct style at its pinnacle.

The Flying Ace,Richard E. Norman,United States,1926,1920s,1:05,"Unlike his 1923 film REGENERATION, Richard Norman’s THE FLYING ACE exists in its entirety, and the image quality is stunning. A rural crime drama revolving around a pair of rival aviators, THE FLYING ACE illuminates the fact that many films made for African American audiences were less concerned with race than with making popular entertainment in the traditional Hollywood style. Filmed in the Arlington area of Jacksonville, Florida, THE FLYING ACE is a unique aviation melodrama in that no airplanes actually leave the ground (the spectacular flight scenes being performed on terra firma, in front of neutral backdrops). Norman divided the film into four chapters, so that exhibitors could show the film as a feature or as a four-episode serial. The film is buoyed by the presence of Norman Studios regular Steve “Peg” Reynolds as the hero’s one-legged sidekick, who in one memorable scene rides a bicycle while firing a rifle built into the shaft of his crutch.",1.08,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-flying-ace
Following,Christopher Nolan,United Kingdom,1999,1990s,1:10,"Before he became a sensation with the twisty revenge story MEMENTO, Christopher Nolan fashioned this low-budget, 16 mm black-and-white neonoir with comparable precision and cunning. Providing irrefutable evidence of Nolan’s directorial bravura, FOLLOWING is the fragmented tale of an unemployed young writer who trails strangers through London, hoping that they will provide inspiration for his first novel. He gets more than he bargained for when one of his unwitting subjects leads him down a dark criminal path. With gritty aesthetics and a made-on-the-fly vibe (many shots were simply stolen on the streets, unbeknownst to passersby), FOLLOWING is a mind-bending psychological journey that shows the remarkable beginnings of one of today’s most acclaimed filmmakers.",1.17,https://www.criterionchannel.com/following
For All Mankind,Al Reinert,United States,1989,1980s,1:20,"In July 1969, the space race ended when Apollo 11 fulfilled President Kennedy’s challenge of “landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” No one who witnessed the lunar landing will ever forget it. Al Reinert’s documentary FOR ALL MANKIND is the story of the twenty-four men who traveled to the moon, told in their words, in their voices, using the images of their experiences. Forty years after the first moon landing, it remains the most radical, visually dazzling work of cinema yet made about this earthshaking event.",1.33,https://www.criterionchannel.com/for-all-mankind
The Forbidden Room,Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson,Canada,2015,2010s,1:59,"THE FORBIDDEN ROOM is Guy Maddin’s ultimate phantasmagoria. Honoring classic cinema while electrocuting it with energy, this Russian nesting doll of a film begins with the crew of a doomed submarine chewing flapjacks in a desperate attempt to breathe the oxygen within them. Suddenly, impossibly, a lost woodsman wanders into their company and tells his tale of escaping from a fearsome clan of cave dwellers. From here, Maddin and codirector Evan Johnson take us high into the air, around the world, and into dreamscapes, spinning tales of amnesia, captivity, deception, and murder, skeleton women and vampire bananas. Created with the help of master poet John Ashbery, this grand ode to lost cinema features Mathieu Amalric, Udo Kier, Charlotte Rampling, Geraldine Chaplin, and Adèle Haenel.",1.98,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-forbidden-room
Foreign Correspondent,Alfred Hitchcock,United States,1940,1940s,2:00,"In 1940, Alfred Hitchcock made his official transition from the British film industry to Hollywood. And it was quite a year: his first two American movies, REBECCA and FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, were both nominated for the best picture Oscar. Though REBECCA prevailed, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT is the more quintessential Hitch film. A full-throttle espionage thriller, starring Joel McCrea as a green Yank reporter sent to Europe to get the scoop on the imminent war, it’s wall-to-wall witty repartee, head-spinning plot twists, and brilliantly mounted suspense set pieces, including an ocean plane crash climax with astonishing special effects. FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT deserves to be mentioned alongside THE 39 STEPS and NORTH BY NORTHWEST as one of the master’s greatest adventures.",2.0,https://www.criterionchannel.com/foreign-correspondent

Dissatisfied with the drab routine of his corporate job, Dae-ho (the always fantastic Song Kang-ho, in his first leading role) finds a surprising outlet for his hidden talents in the wrestling ring—bringing about a transformation that affects his entire life. Putting an irresistibly offbeat spin on the typical sports-movie formula, THE FOUL KING was a smash hit that helped make Song (who did most of his own stunts) one of South Korea’s most in-demand stars.",1.85,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-foul-king
Fountainhead,Masaki Kobayashi,Japan,1956,1950s,2:09,"FOUNTAINHEAD (1956, aka IZUMI) is one of Masaki Kobayashi's ""comeback"" films into the Japanese studio system, a mainstream lyrical romantic drama that proved the commercial appeal of his work. It was also the place where he started setting the stage for his later career, assembling the cast members who would populate his more personal movies in the years to come: Fumio Watanabe (in his screen debut), who would star in Kobayashi's BLACK RIVER and work in the director's THE HUMAN CONDITION II; leading lady Ineko Arima, who had previously been associated with the films of Nikio Naruse, and who would later also star in BLACK RIVER and THE HUMAN CONDITION I; and Keiji Sada, who would work in THE HUMAN CONDITION I.

Set at the end of the nineteenth century, THE FOUR FEATHERS follows the travails of a young officer (John Clements) accused of cowardice after he resigns his post on the eve of a major deployment to Khartoum; he must then fight to redeem himself in the eyes of his fellow officers (including Ralph Richardson) and fiancée (June Duprez). Featuring music by Miklós Rózsa and Oscar-nominated cinematography by Georges Périnal and Osmond Borradaile, THE FOUR FEATHERS is a thrilling, thunderous epic.",1.92,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-four-feathers
Fox and His Friends,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1975,1970s,2:04,"A lottery win leads not to financial and emotional freedom but to social captivity, in this wildly cynical classic about love and exploitation by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Casting himself against type, the director plays a suggestible working-class innocent who lets himself be taken advantage of by his bourgeois new boyfriend and his circle of materialistic friends, leading to the kind of resonant misery that only Fassbinder could create. FOX AND HIS FRIENDS is unsparing social commentary, an amusingly pitiless and groundbreaking if controversial depiction of a gay community in 1970s West Germany.",2.07,https://www.criterionchannel.com/fox-and-his-friends

Meticulously directed by Noah Baumbach with a free-and-easy vibe reminiscent of the French New Wave’s most spirited films, and written by Baumbach and Gerwig with an effortless combination of sweetness and wit, FRANCES HA gets at both the frustrations and the joys of being young and unsure of where to go next.

The Freshman,Sam Taylor…,United States,1925,1920s,1:16,"Harold Lloyd’s biggest box-office hit was this silent comedy gem, featuring the befuddled everyman at his eager best as a new college student. Though he dreams of being a big man on campus, the freshman’s careful plans inevitably go hilariously awry, be it on the football field or at the Fall Frolic. But he gets a climactic chance to prove his mettle—and impress the sweet girl he loves—in one of the most famous sports sequences ever filmed.

FROWNLAND has garnered both passionate raves and scathing denunciations, while festival screenings have ended in screaming matches between patrons. It's strong stuff, yes, but none of its notorious reputation does justice to its savage dark humor, emotional heft, and stylistic audacity. Above all else, FROWNLAND is a pitch-black character study of Keith Sontag (Dore Mann), a neurotic, manipulative, stridently unlovable New Yorker whose pitiless roommate aptly describes him, to his face, as “a burbling troll in his underwear.” With the most basic elements of human communication a struggle, Keith lurches his way through an uncaring city, attempting to aid a suicidal friend, evict his unctuous roommate, and simply attain some measure of self-respect.

In a series of escalating “games,” the sadistic duo subject their victims to unspeakable physical and psychological torture over the course of a night. A home-invasion thriller in which the genre’s threat of bloodshed is made stomach-churningly real, the film ratchets up shocks even as its executioners interrupt the action to address the audience, drawing queasy attention to the way that cinema milks pleasure from pain and stokes our appetite for atrocity.

Three years into a murderous regime that would be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans, Amin prepared a triumphal greeting for the filmmakers, staging rallies, military maneuvers, and cheery displays of national pride, and envisioning the film as an official portrait to adorn his cult of personality. Schroeder, however, had other ideas, emerging with a disquieting, caustically funny brief against Amin, in which the dictator’s own endless stream of testimony—by turns charming, menacing, and nonsensical—serves as the most damning evidence.

The Gleaners and I: Two Years Later,Agnès Varda,France,2002,2000s,1:02,"Agnès Varda’s charming follow-up to her acclaimed documentary THE GLEANERS AND I is a deceptively unassuming grace note that takes us deeper into the world of those who find purpose and beauty in the refuse of society. Revisiting many of the original film’s subjects to explore the often unexpected effects that their participation in the project has had on their lives, this wonderfully warm and human epilogue once again takes gleaning as the starting point from which to explore what most interests Varda: the richness, complexity, and poignancy of life outside the mainstream. What emerges is a crazy-quilt tapestry of the personal, the political, and the esoteric that celebrates the spirit and creativity of those who forge their own path.",1.03,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-gleaners-and-i-two-years-later

Amid the consumerist wonderland of a shopping mall, a cadre of store employees bounce in and out of one another’s arms in a cycle of breakups, makeups, misunderstandings, and reunions, their romantic roundelay punctuated by imaginatively stylized production numbers. Working with frequent star Delphine Seyrig and a remarkable team of writers—who between them penned everything from JULES AND JIM to DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN—Akerman deftly balances the shiny pop pleasures of the genre with piercing variations on her signature themes, including a startlingly moving reflection on Jewish resilience and the legacy of the Holocaust.",1.62,https://www.criterionchannel.com/golden-eighties

Ozu weaves a wealth of subtle gags through a family portrait as rich as those of his dramatic films, mocking the foibles of the adult world through the eyes of his child protagonists. Shot in stunning color and set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new washing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door salesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I WAS BORN, BUT . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan.",1.57,https://www.criterionchannel.com/good-morning

In it, Gray, with typical sardonic relish, chronicles his arduous journey through the diagnosis and treatment of a rare and alarming ocular condition. For the monologist, this experience occasioned a meditation on illness and mortality, medicine and metaphysics; for the filmmaker, it was a chance to experiment with ways of bringing his subject's words to brilliant, eye-opening life.",1.32,https://www.criterionchannel.com/gray-s-anatomy

But on his sixty-fifth birthday, Jep unexpectedly finds himself taking stock of his life, turning his cutting wit on himself and his contemporaries, and looking past the lavish nightclubs, parties, and cafés to find Rome itself, in all its monumental glory: a timeless landscape of absurd, exquisite beauty. Featuring sensuous cinematography, a lush score, and an award-winning central performance by the great Toni Servillo, this transporting experience by the brilliant Italian director Paolo Sorrentino is a breathtaking Felliniesque tale of decadence and lost love.",2.35,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-great-beauty
The Great Dictator,Charles Chaplin,United States,1940,1940s,2:05,"In his controversial masterpiece THE GREAT DICTATOR, Charlie Chaplin offers both a cutting caricature of Adolf Hitler and a sly tweaking of his own comic persona. Chaplin, in his first pure talkie, brings his sublime physicality to two roles: the cruel yet clownish “Tomainian” dictator and the kindly Jewish barber who is mistaken for him. Featuring Jack Oakie and Paulette Goddard in stellar supporting turns, THE GREAT DICTATOR, boldly going after the fascist leader before the U.S.’s official entry into World War II, is an audacious amalgam of politics and slapstick that culminates in Chaplin’s famously impassioned speech.",2.08,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-great-dictator

Brian Donlevy stars as Dan McGinty, a Depression-era hobo who becomes a “professional voter” for a crooked Chicago political boss, casting ballots under a variety of assumed names. McGinty’s facility for vice allows him to rise easily through the ranks of the city’s corrupt political machine—but will a rare act of honesty be his undoing?

The plot is a piercing look at postwar Britain, and efforts to move the nation into the modern age -- that doesn't sit well with the people of Anderia Marsh, who have claimed a right (going back to Henry III) to evade government-imposed import duties and taxes. And when the government decides to curb this right, the whole village quietly rises up in a comical rebellion.",1.3,https://www.criterionchannel.com/green-grow-the-rushes

A newcomer to the game of love, Gregory has no idea how to pursue the object of his affection and seeks advice from a most surprising source: his ten-year-old sister (Allison Forster).

Arendt’s reporting on the 1961 trial of ex-Nazi Adolf Eichmann in the “New Yorker”—controversial both for her portrayal of Eichmann and the Jewish councils—introduced her now-famous concept of the “banality of evil.” Using footage from the actual Eichmann trial and weaving a narrative that spans three countries, von Trotta elegantly turns the often-invisible passion for thought into immersive, dramatic cinema.",1.88,https://www.criterionchannel.com/hannah-arendt

Far from a dry dissertation on the topic, the film itself is a witches’ brew of the scary, the gross, and the darkly humorous.

Fishlike humanoid creatures, spawned by mutant DNA, begin rising from the ocean looking to mate with the local women. Scientist Susan Drake (Ann Turkel) along with local fisherman Jim Hill (Doug McClure) seek to investigate the cause of this invasion of creatures from the ocean floor. But when the annual Salmon Festival begins, some unwanted guests arrive to crash the festivities. Swimming in gore and gratuitous nudity, HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP updates the classic drive-in creature feature for the era of grindhouse sleaze.",1.32,https://www.criterionchannel.com/humanoids-from-the-deep
Hunger,Steve McQueen,Ireland,2008,2000s,1:36,"With HUNGER, British filmmaker and artist Steve McQueen has turned one of history’s most controversial acts of political defiance into a jarring, unforgettable cinematic experience. In Northern Ireland’s Maze prison in 1981, twenty-seven-year-old Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands went on a hunger strike to protest the British government’s refusal to recognize him and his fellow IRA inmates as political prisoners. McQueen dramatizes prison existence and Sands’s final days in a way that is purely experiential, even abstract, a succession of images full of both beauty and horror. Featuring an intense performance by Michael Fassbender, HUNGER is an unflinching, transcendent depiction of what a human being is willing to endure to be heard.",1.6,https://www.criterionchannel.com/hunger-1

This landmark document of Swedish society during the sexual revolution has been declared both obscene and revolutionary. It tells the story of Lena (Lena Nyman), a searching and rebellious young woman, and her personal quest to understand the social and political conditions in 1960s Sweden, as well as her bold exploration of her own sexual identity. I Am Curious-Yellow is a subversive mix of dramatic and documentary techniques, attacking capitalist injustices and frankly addressing the politics of sexuality.",2.02,https://www.criterionchannel.com/i-am-curious-yellow

Ice,Robert Kramer,United States,1970,1970s,2:07,"Shot with documentarylike immediacy on the streets of New York City, this innovative independent thriller centers on a band of revolutionaries plotting to overthrow a fascistic political regime. Using a fictitious war with Mexico as an allegory for the conflict in Vietnam, director Robert Kramer employs a striking mix of dystopian science fiction, faux vérité realism, and agitprop to dramatize the inner workings, disputes, and tensions within the group as they plan guerrilla attacks against the American government. A landmark of leftist filmmaking in America, ICE is more than just an essential time capsule of post-1968 political thought; its lessons on radical resistance and struggle remain as timely as ever.",2.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/ice

After his wife leaves him, a film director finds himself drawn into affairs with two enigmatic women: at the same time, he searches for the right subject and actress for his next film. This spellbinding antiromance was a late-career coup for the legendary Italian filmmaker, and is renowned for its sexual explicitness and an extended scene on a fog-enshrouded highway that stands with the director’s greatest set pieces.",2.17,https://www.criterionchannel.com/identification-of-a-woman

Takashi Shimura beautifully portrays Kanji Watanabe, an aging bureaucrat with stomach cancer who is impelled to find meaning in his final days.

I Knew Her Well,Antonio Pietrangeli,Italy,1965,1960s,1:55,"Following the gorgeous, seemingly liberated Adriana (DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE’s Stefania Sandrelli) as she chases her dreams in the Rome of LA DOLCE VITA, I KNEW HER WELL is at once a delightful immersion in the popular music and style of Italy in the sixties and a biting critique of its sexual politics and the culture of celebrity. Over a series of intimate episodes, just about every one featuring a different man, a new hairstyle, and an outfit to match, the unsung Italian master Antonio Pietrangeli, working from a script he cowrote with Ettore Scola, composes a deft, seriocomic character study that never strays from its complicated central figure. I KNEW HER WELL is a thrilling rediscovery, by turns funny, tragic, and altogether jaw-dropping.",1.92,https://www.criterionchannel.com/i-knew-her-well

While holidaying in Ireland, her mental state becomes increasingly unstable, resulting in paranoia, visions of a doppelgänger, and violence.

I’m All Right Jack,John Boulting,United Kingdom,1959,1950s,1:45,"One of a string of incisive social satires made by British filmmaking duo the Boulting brothers is a smartly caustic look at issues of corporate corruption and trade unionism in 1950s England. Unable to procure a job, upper-class Stanley Windrush (Ian Carmichael) takes a position on the floor of a factory owned by his uncle—and soon finds himself caught between management and labor in their struggle for power.

While catching some rays on his brother’s yacht, Scott Carey (Grant Williams) is enveloped by a mysterious cloud. Soon after, he discovers that he’s getting thinner—and smaller. As the rapidly diminishing Scott adjusts to a new life in which ordinary house cats and spiders are adversaries in a fight for survival, he is also left to ponder the meaning of his increasingly small place in the universe.

But soon, through a series of events too serpentine and surprising to spoil, the two men are brought together by a dangerous mission that takes them from suburban New Jersey to Honduras.

And at its center is a (real-life) character you won't soon forget: Dragoljub Aleksic, an acrobat, locksmith, and Houdini-style escape artist whom Makavejev uses as the absurd and wondrous basis for a look back at his country's tumultuous recent history.",1.32,https://www.criterionchannel.com/innocence-unprotected

Insiang,Lino Brocka,Philippines,1976,1970s,1:34,"Jealousy and violence take center stage in this claustrophobic melodrama, a tautly constructed character study set in the slums of Manila. Lino Brocka crafts an eviscerating portrait of an innocent daughter and her bitter mother as women scorned. Insiang leads a quiet life dominated by household duties, but after she is raped by her mother’s lover and abandoned by the young man who claims to care for her, she exacts vicious revenge.

With a combination of whimsy and dread, Roeg creates a fun-house-mirror image of fifties America in order to reflect on the nature of celebrity and lingering cold-war nuclear nightmares.

In Rome to make a documentary about the great filmmaker, a Japanese camera crew follows Fellini on a tour through his longtime home studio of Cinecittà as the maestro’s memories and fantasies unfurl in a dizzying, dazzling, time-bending love letter to the art and spectacle of moviemaking. The film’s sprawling vision even makes room for an appearance by Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg who, in an unforgettable bit of movie magic, relive their iconic Trevi Fountain scene from LA DOLCE VITA, lent new poignancy by the tacit acknowledgement of time’s passing.",1.78,https://www.criterionchannel.com/intervista

Their encounters are formal and polite—until a discovery about their spouses creates an intimate bond between them. At once delicately mannered and visually extravagant, Wong Kar-wai’s IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is a masterful evocation of romantic longing and fleeting moments. With its aching musical soundtrack and exquisitely abstract cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Mark Lee Ping-bin, this film has been a major stylistic influence on the past decade of cinema, and is a milestone in Wong’s redoubtable career.",1.63,https://www.criterionchannel.com/in-the-mood-for-love

Based on a true incident, it graphically depicts the all-consuming, transcendent—but ultimately destructive—love of a man and a woman (Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda) living in an era of ever escalating imperialism and governmental control.

In Vanda’s Room,Pedro Costa,Portugal,2000,2000s,2:50,"For the extraordinarily beautiful second film in his Fontainhas trilogy, Pedro Costa jettisoned his earlier films' larger crews to burrow even deeper into the Lisbon ghetto and the lives of its desperate inhabitants. With the intimate feel of a documentary and the texture of a Vermeer painting, IN VANDA'S ROOM takes an unflinching, fragmentary look at a handful of self-destructive, marginalized people, but is centered around the heroin-addicted Vanda Duarte. Costa presents the daily routines of Vanda and her neighbors with disarming matter-of-factness, and through his camera, individuals whom many would deem disposable become vivid and vital. This was Costa's first use of digital video, and the evocative images he created remain some of the medium's most astonishing.",2.83,https://www.criterionchannel.com/in-vanda-s-room

Irma Vep,Olivier Assayas,France,1996,1990s,1:39,"Olivier Assayas’s live-wire international breakthrough stars a magnetic Maggie Cheung as a version of herself: a Hong Kong action movie star who arrives in Paris to play the latex-clad lead in a remake of Louis Feuillade’s classic 1915 crime serial LES VAMPIRES. What she finds is a behind-the-scenes tangle of barely controlled chaos as egos clash, romantic attractions simmer, and an obsessive director (a cannily cast Jean-Pierre Léaud) drives himself to the brink to realize his vision. Blending blasts of silent cinema, martial arts flicks, and the music of Sonic Youth and Ali Farka Touré into a hallucinatory swirl of postmodern cool, Assayas composes a witty reflection on the nineties French film industry and the eternal tension between art and commercial entertainment.",1.65,https://www.criterionchannel.com/irma-vep

A storm forces the small crew below deck, and tension builds to a violent climax.

In a richly layered performance, Binoche plays Isabelle, a successful painter in Paris whose apparent independence belies what she desires most: real romantic fulfillment. Isabelle reveals deep wells of yearning, vulnerability, and resilience as she tumbles into relationships with all the wrong men.

Anton Walbrook and Deborah Kerr provide unforgettable support, he as a German enemy turned lifelong friend of Candy’s and she as young women of three consecutive generations, a socially committed governess, a sweet-souled war nurse, and a modern-thinking army driver, who inspire him.

The film functions as a distorted mirror image of Solondz’s acclaimed 1998 dark comedy HAPPINESS, its emotionally stunted characters now groping for the possibility of change in a post-9/11 world. HAPPINESS’s grim New Jersey setting is transposed mainly to sunny Florida, but the biggest twist is that new actors fill the roles from the earlier film—including Shirley Henderson, Allison Janney, and Ally Sheedy as alarmingly dissimilar sisters, and Ciarán Hinds hauntingly embodying a reformed pedophile. Shot in expressionistic tones by cinematographer extraordinaire Ed Lachman, Solondz’s film finds the humor in the tragic and the tragic in the everyday.",1.62,https://www.criterionchannel.com/life-during-wartime
Life Is Sweet,Mike Leigh,United Kingdom,1990,1990s,1:43,"This invigorating film from Mike Leigh was his first international sensation.

Leigh and his typically brilliant cast create, with extraordinary sensitivity and craft, a vivid, lived-in story of ordinary existence, in which even modest dreams—such as the father’s desire to open a food truck—carry enormous weight.",1.72,https://www.criterionchannel.com/life-is-sweet
A Life of Her Own,George Cukor,United States,1950,1950s,1:48,"Lana Turner gives one of her finest performances in this look at the special curse of glamor set amidst a rarefied world of beauty, celebrity, and cocktail parties.

Limelight,Charles Chaplin,United States,1952,1950s,2:17,"Charlie Chaplin’s masterful drama about the twilight of a former vaudeville star is among the writer-director’s most touching films. Chaplin plays Calvero, a once beloved musical-comedy performer, now a washed-up alcoholic who lives in a small London flat. A glimmer of hope arrives when he meets a beautiful but melancholy ballerina (Claire Bloom) who lives downstairs. An elegant mix of the comic and the tragic, this poignant movie also features Buster Keaton in an extended cameo, marking the only time the two silent comedy icons appeared in a film together. Made at a time when Chaplin was under attack by the American press and far right, LIMELIGHT was scarcely distributed in the United States upon its initial release, but it is now considered one of his essential and most personal works.",2.28,https://www.criterionchannel.com/limelight

Inspired by a haunting André Kertész photograph on the cover of a French magazine, this avant-garde silent master­piece centers on a man and two women lost at sea, their pasts unfolding through flashbacks propelled by the music of Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, and others. An early work of independent Latin American filmmaking, LIMITE was famously difficult to see for most of the twentieth century.

Over the course of a summer idyll in upstate New York, the two each experience profound emotional and romantic awakenings.

Renoir, working amidst the rise of Hitler and the Popular Front in France, had need to take license with the dark nature of Gorky’s source material, softening its bleak outlook. Kurosawa, firmly situated in the postwar world, found little reason for hope. He remained faithful to the original with its focus on the conflict between illusion and reality, a theme he would return to over and over again.

In 1895, she is a tragic noblewoman who inadvertently betrays her country for love during the war of independence. In 1932, she is the daughter of a bourgeois family drawn into the workers’ uprising against the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado. And in the postrevolutionary 1960s, she is a newlywed farm girl fighting against patriarchal oppression.

The director gives fierce teeth to her viscerally sensual, darkly feminist twist on Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid,” in which the girls’ bond is tested and their survival threatened after one sister falls for a human.

There, he discovers a painting that reawakens memories of his previous life and his star-crossed romance with a village girl (Vyjayanthimala).

Madonna of the Seven Moons,Arthur Crabtree,United Kingdom,1945,1940s,1:50,"A lurid tale of sex and psychosis, Madonna of the Seven Moons, directed by Arthur Crabtree, is among the wildest of the Gainsborough melodramas.

The Magician,Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1958,1950s,1:41,"With THE MAGICIAN, an engaging, brilliantly conceived tale of chicanery that doubles as a symbolic portrait of the artist as a deceiver, Ingmar Bergman proved himself to be one of cinema’s premier illusionists. Max von Sydow stars as Dr. Vogler, a nineteenth-century traveling mesmerist and peddler of potions whose magic is put to the test in Stockholm by the cruel, eminently rational royal medical adviser Dr. Vergérus (Gunnar Björnstrand).

The two oldest have been married for some time, but according to tradition, the rebellious youngest sister cannot wed until the third, conservative and terribly shy, finds a husband.

Mala Noche,Gus Van Sant,United States,1985,1980s,1:17,"With its low budget and lush black-and-white imagery, Gus Van Sant’s debut feature MALA NOCHE heralded an idiosyncratic, provocative new voice in American independent film. Set in Van Sant’s hometown of Portland, Oregon, the film evokes a world of transient workers, dead-end day-shifters, and bars and seedy apartments bathed in a profound nighttime, as it follows a romantic deadbeat with a wayward crush on a handsome Mexican immigrant. MALA NOCHE was an important prelude to the New Queer Cinema of the nineties and is a fascinating capsule from a time and place that continues to haunt its director’s work.",1.28,https://www.criterionchannel.com/mala-noche

The Manchurian Candidate,John Frankenheimer,United States,1962,1960s,2:06,"The name John Frankenheimer became forever synonymous with heart-in-the-throat filmmaking when this quintessential sixties political thriller was released.

In an unforgettable performance, Angela Lansbury plays Raymond’s villainous mother, the controlling wife of a witch-hunting anti-Communist senator with his eyes on the White House.

One of Sembène’s most coruscatingly funny and indignant films, MANDABI—an adaptation of a novella by the director himself—is a bitterly ironic depiction of a society scarred by colonialism and plagued by corruption, greed, and poverty.",1.53,https://www.criterionchannel.com/mandabi
A Man Escaped,Robert Bresson,France,1956,1950s,1:40,"With the simplest of concepts and sparest of techniques, Robert Bresson made one of the most suspenseful jailbreak films of all time in A MAN ESCAPED. Based on the account of an imprisoned French Resistance leader, this unbelievably taut and methodical marvel follows the fictional Fontaine’s single-minded pursuit of freedom, detailing the planning and execution of his escape with gripping precision.

Manila in the Claws of Light,Lino Brocka,Philippines,1975,1970s,2:06,"Lino Brocka achieved international acclaim with this candid portrait of 1970s Manila, a breakout example of the more serious-minded filmmaking the director had turned to after building a career on mainstream movies he described as “soaps.” A young fisherman from a provincial village arrives in the capital on a quest to track down his girlfriend, who was lured there with the promise of work and hasn’t been heard from since. In the meantime, he takes a low-wage job at a construction site and witnesses life on the streets, where death strikes without warning, corruption and exploitation are commonplace, and protests hint at escalating civil unrest.

The star-to-be plays Lord Rohan, a cruel nobleman who marries the naive and sweet-natured Clarissa (Phyllis Calvert) for the sole purpose of producing an heir; meanwhile, Clarissa's conniving best friend, Hesther (Margaret Lockwood), plots against her for her own nefarious ends. THE MAN IN GREY, directed by Leslie Arliss, was such a box-office success that Gainsborough used it as a template, launching a cycle of increasingly rococo films.",1.93,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-man-in-grey

For this first feature, following years of making documentaries and experimental shorts, Dusan Makavejev and his crew set up shop in Bor, a mining town in the mountains near Yugoslavia's border with Bulgaria, interviewing the workers in the region and even shooting footage inside the local ore factories. Yet the result is hardly a staid tribute to the working class.

Situated among the frequent and violent storms that slam into its barren landscape, the islands are 'three wastes of rock' off the western coast of Ireland.

This fleet and gripping film is the first of the early thrillers the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, made during the fertile phase of his career spent at the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. Besides affirming Hitchcock’s genius, it gave the brilliant Peter Lorre his first English-speaking role, as a slithery villain. With its tension and gallows humor, it’s pure Hitchcock, and it set the tone for such films as THE 39 STEPS and THE LADY VANISHES.",1.27,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-man-who-knew-too-much

Marathon,Carlos Saura,Sweden,1993,1990s,2:10,"Carlos Saura's film of the Games of the XXV Olympiad Barcelona 1992 brings a visual flair and humanism that paid excellent tribute to the Games and to the Catalan capital. The title event, the men's marathon, was chosen both as symbol and leitmotif, in part because the race took place in the streets of Barcelona, but also because of the effort and endurance required in this most arduous of Olympic events. Saura was excited at the prospect of delivering a film that would run approximately the same length as the time a men's marathon winner might achieve, hence this director's cut of MARATHON at two hours and ten minutes.",2.17,https://www.criterionchannel.com/marathon-1

Marianne and Juliane,Margarethe von Trotta,West Germany,1981,1980s,1:47,"Based on the true story of the Enslein sisters, this searing drama is arguably the purest expression of Margarethe Von Trotta’s combination of the personal and the political. Juliane (Jutta Lampe) is a feminist journalist, arguing for abortion rights; Marianne (Barbara Sukowa) is a terrorist revolutionary in a Baader-Meinhof-like militant group. As Marianne’s political activism begins to take a personal toll, Juliane finds herself torn between her politics and her need to protect her sister and her family. But when Marianne is imprisoned, Juliane is forced to confront the realities of the harsh power of the state. Von Trotta’s first collaboration with her muse Barbara Sukowa won the Golden Lion at the 1981 Venice Film Festival—the first time a woman filmmaker received the top prize—and was selected by Ingmar Bergman as one of his favorite films of all time.",1.78,https://www.criterionchannel.com/marianne-and-juliane

Based on a novel by Vladislav Vančura, this stirring and poetic depiction of a feud between two rival medieval clans is a fierce, epic, and meticulously designed evocation of the clashes between Christianity and paganism, humankind and nature, love and violence. Vláčil’s approach was to re-create the textures and mentalities of a long-ago way of life, rather than to make a conventional historical drama, and the result is dazzling. With its inventive widescreen cinematography, editing, and sound design, MARKETA LAZAROVÁ is an experimental action film.",2.75,https://www.criterionchannel.com/marketa-lazarova

Kati Outinen is memorably impenetrable as Iris, whose grinding days as a cog in a factory wheel, and nights as a neglected daughter living with her parents, ultimately send her over the edge.

Maurice,James Ivory,United Kingdom,1987,1980s,2:20,"James Ivory’s sumptuously romantic adaptation of E. M.

At a time when homosexuality is punishable by imprisonment, the two must keep their feelings for one another a complete secret. After Clive abandons his forbidden love and marries a woman, Maurice is left alone to struggle with his identity and self-confidence—until a chance encounter brings about a profound change in his life and outlook.",2.33,https://www.criterionchannel.com/maurice

Me and You and Everyone We Know,Miranda July,United States,2005,2000s,1:31,"With this compassionate, startling comedy that could have come from no other artistic sensibility, the brilliant Miranda July reveals a world both familiar and strange—an original vision of creativity, sexuality, childhood, and loneliness that emerges from a series of braided vignettes around a pair of potential lovers: Richard, a newly single shoe salesman and father of two (John Hawkes), and Christine, a lonely video artist and “Eldercab” driver (July). While they take hesitant steps toward romance, Richard’s sons follow their own curiosity toward their first sexual experiences, online and in real life, venturing into uncharted territories in their attempts to connect with others. Playful and profoundly transgressive, ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW is a poetic look at the tortuous routes we take to intimacy in an isolating world, and the moments of magic and redemption that unite us.",1.52,https://www.criterionchannel.com/me-and-you-and-everyone-we-know
Meantime,Mike Leigh,United Kingdom,1984,1980s,1:47,"A slow-burning depiction of economic degradation in Thatcher’s England, Mike Leigh’s MEANTIME is the culmination of the writer-director’s pioneering work in television. Unemployment is rampant in London’s working-class East End, where a middle-aged couple and their two sons languish in a claustrophobic public-housing flat. As the brothers (Phil Daniels and Tim Roth) grow increasingly disaffected, Leigh punctuates the grinding boredom of their daily existence with tense encounters, including with a priggish aunt (Marion Bailey) who has managed to become middle-class and a blithering skinhead on the verge of psychosis (a scene-stealing Gary Oldman, in his first major role). Informed by Leigh’s now trademark improvisational process and propelled by the lurching rhythms of its Beckett-like dialogue, MEANTIME is an unrelenting, often blisteringly funny look at life on the dole.",1.78,https://www.criterionchannel.com/meantime
The Melbourne Rendez-vous,René Lucot,France,1957,1950s,1:46,"Of the two feature endeavors made around the Games of the XVI Olympiad in 1956, THE MELBOURNE RENDEZ-VOUS, directed by René Lucot, excels. Its tone is more observant and more inquiring than that of most Olympic films. Shooting in Agfacolor, Lucot and his crew focus on the human aspect of the Melbourne Games, in a quirky manner that prefigures Kon Ichikawa's TOKYO OLYMPIAD, to be made eight years later.",1.77,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-melbourne-rendez-vous
Memories of Underdevelopment,Tomás Gutiérrez Alea,Cuba,1968,1960s,1:39,"This film by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea is the most renowned work in the history of Cuban cinema. After his wife and family flee in the wake of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the bourgeois intellectual Sergio (Sergio Corrieri) passes his days wandering Havana in idle reflection, his amorous entanglements and political ambivalence gradually giving way to a mounting sense of alienation. With this adaptation of an innovative novel by Edmundo Desnoes, Gutiérrez Alea developed a cinematic style as radical as the times he was chronicling, creating a collage of vivid impressions through the use of experimental editing techniques, archival material, and spontaneously shot street scenes. Intimate and densely layered, MEMORIES OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT provides an indictment of its protagonist’s disengagement and an extraordinary glimpse of life in postrevolutionary Cuba.",1.65,https://www.criterionchannel.com/memories-of-underdevelopment

The Merchant of Four Seasons,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,Germany,1971,1970s,1:28,"New German Cinema icon Rainer Werner Fassbinder kicked off a new phase of his young career when he made the startling THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS. In this anguished yet mordantly funny film, Fassbinder charts the decline of a self-destructive former policeman and war veteran struggling to make ends meet for his family by working as a fruit vendor. Fassbinder had gained acclaim for a series of trenchant, quickly made early films, but for this one he took more time and forged a new style—featuring a more complexly woven script and narrative structure and more sophisticated use of the camera, and influenced by the work of his recently discovered idol, Douglas Sirk.

Rock star Ryuichi Sakamoto (who also composed this film’s hypnotic score) plays the camp commander, obsessed with the mysterious blond major, while Tom Conti is the British lieutenant colonel Lawrence, who tries to bridge the emotional and language divides between captor and prisoner. Also featuring actor-director Takeshi Kitano in his first dramatic role, MERRY CHRISTMAS MR.

Terrified, he calls on Mikey (Falk), the one person he thinks can save him. Scripted to match the live-wire energy of its stars—alongside supporting players Ned Beatty, Joyce Van Patten, and Carol Grace—and inspired by real-life characters from May’s own childhood, this unbridled portrait of male friendship turned tragic is an unsung masterpiece of American cinema.",1.77,https://www.criterionchannel.com/mikey-and-nicky

En route to London after being released from a mental institution, Stephen Neale (Ray Milland) stops at a seemingly innocent village fair, after which he finds himself caught in the web of a sinister underworld with possible Nazi connections. Lang was among the most illustrious of the European émigré filmmakers working in Hollywood during World War II, and MINISTRY OF FEAR is one of his finest American productions, an unpredictable thriller with style to spare.",1.45,https://www.criterionchannel.com/ministry-of-fear

Taking place on the last day of Mishima’s life, when he famously committed public seppuku, the film is punctuated by extended flashbacks to the writer’s past as well as gloriously stylized evocations of his fictional works. With its rich cinematography by John Bailey, exquisite sets and costumes by Eiko Ishioka, and unforgettable, highly influential score by Philip Glass, MISHIMA: A LIFE IN FOUR CHAPTERS is a tribute to its subject and a bold, investigative work of art in its own right.",2.02,https://www.criterionchannel.com/mishima-a-life-in-four-chapters

From the time when the repressive Khmer Rouge ruled over Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, the only recorded artifacts that remain are propaganda footage. Using beautifully detailed clay figurines and elaborate dioramas, Panh poignantly and poetically recreates the missing images from his past, giving new life to his recollections of his friends and family both before and after the regime’s rule.

Charting his rise and fall with a single-minded focus on the bloody business at hand, the film is at once gritty and operatic, placing the viewer right in the thick of the ring’s action, as close to death as possible. Like all of the great Italian truth seeker’s films, this is not just an electrifying drama but also a profound and moving inquiry into a violent world—and it’s perhaps the greatest bullfighting movie ever made.",1.78,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-moment-of-truth

A trio of people (Gerard Depardieu, Nicole Garcia, Roger Pierre) are presented as “case histories” by a lecturer—and we see them not only in their work environments, but also in terms of the cinematic role models (Jean Gabin, Jean Marais, Danielle Darrieux) that have helped shape their self-images.",2.1,https://www.criterionchannel.com/mon-oncle-d-amerique

In perhaps the finest performance of his career, Alain Delon stars as the wealthy Robert Klein, an amoral art dealer in Nazi-occupied Paris who exploits the persecution of his Jewish countrymen by buying and selling their paintings. When Klein is mistaken for a Jewish man of the same name, he is plunged into a labyrinthine identity crisis with life-or-death consequences.

Seizing the opportunity to exploit his honesty, actor Suzy Courtois (Nadia Gray) convinces her lover, the corrupt city council member Castel Benac (Herbert Lom), to hire Topaze as a managing director for one of his shady businesses—leading the once-upstanding teacher down a path of moral corruption.

Multiple Maniacs,John Waters,United States,1970,1970s,1:36,"The gloriously grotesque second feature directed by John Waters is replete with all manner of depravity, from robbery to murder to one of cinema’s most memorably blasphemous moments. Made on a shoestring budget in Waters’ native Baltimore, with the filmmaker taking on nearly every technical task, this gleeful mockery of the peace-and-love ethos of its era features the Cavalcade of Perversion, a traveling show mounted by a troupe of misfits whose shocking proclivities are topped only by those of their leader: the glammer-than-glam, larger-than-life Divine, out for blood after discovering her lover’s affair.

Meanwhile, her stepson is tormented by his own ghosts, related to his service in France's recently ended war in Algeria.

His greatest joy is the music room in which he has hosted lavish concerts over the years—now a shadow of its former vivid self.

When a handsome landowner (Sam Neill), disarmed by her unruly charms, begins to court her, Sybylla must decide whether she can reconcile the prospect of marriage with the illustrious life’s work she has imagined for herself.

Nine Days of One Year,Mikhail Romm,Soviet Union,1962,1960s,1:49,"Dmitriy Gusev, a nuclear physicist, receives a dangerously high dose of radiation as a result of an accident in which his professor, Sintsov, is fatally exposed. Warned that another exposure would prove fatal, Dmitriy nevertheless refuses a safer job and continues the experimentation. Lyolya, Dmitriy's girl friend, feels that their relationship means little to him and decides to marry their best friend, theoretician Ilya Kulikov. Learning that Dmitriy's life is in danger, however, she realizes that she loves him, and they marry despite his misgivings. From the outset of the marriage, Dmitriy's singular devotion to his work keeps them apart. At a Siberian research center, Dmitriy works together with Ilya, and though Ilya's cynical manner is so different from his own, their disagreements do nothing to mar their friendship and mutual respect. As a new success is obtained, Dmitriy is again exposed to radiation. He persuades Ilya to keep the accident a secret until the experiments are completed. Lyolya, misunderstanding Dmitriy's remoteness, feels that she has failed as a wife. Dmitriy's health deteriorates, and, aware of his doom, he makes a visit to his family. At a Moscow clinic he asks doctors to perform an experimental bone marrow transplant with little chance of success. Ilya comes to visit him on the day before the operation and tells him that their experiments produced a new type of radiation which was not thermonuclear, as anticipated, but nonetheless would be an important contribution to science. As Ilya and Lyolya await the outcome of the operation at the hospital, they receive a note from Dmitriy promising a celebration.",1.82,https://www.criterionchannel.com/nine-days-of-one-year
The Ninth Configuration,William Peter Blatty,United States,1980,1980s,1:57,"Written, produced, and directed by THE EXORCIST author William Peter Blatty, this utterly singular comedy-horror whatsit is a work of both wondrous strangeness and cosmic brilliance. Assigned to take charge of an army mental hospital situated in a secluded castle, military psychiatrist Colonel Vincent Kane (Stacy Keach) finds himself drawn to former astronaut Billy Cutshaw (Scott Wilson), who suffered a mental breakdown just before an aborted moon launch.

Murnau's hauntingly atmospheric adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" stars an iconic Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a nightmarish, spidery creature of bulbous head and taloned claws, who remains perhaps the most genuinely disturbing incarnation of vampirism ever imagined on screen. When Orlok summons a young real estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim) to his mountain castle with the intention of purchasing a home, it soon becomes clear that the creepy Count has ulterior motives. Shooting on location in the Carpathian mountains, Murnau imbues his celebrated shots of nature and landscapes with a twisted, sinister quality that heightens the air of expressionistic dread.",1.58,https://www.criterionchannel.com/nosferatu

French New Wave icon Michel Piccoli is a mysterious aging impresario named Simon Cinéma who has hired a young film student, Camille (Julie Gayet), to simply sit with him at his mansion and talk about movies. Skeptical yet increasingly enchanted, Camille bears witness to cinema itself coming to life, allowing Varda to wittily integrate a mind-boggling parade of appearances by screen legends (Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anouk Aimée, Robert De Niro, and many others), and attest to the vigorous health of the movies at the close of the twentieth century.",1.75,https://www.criterionchannel.com/one-hundred-and-one-nights

Ossos,Pedro Costa,Portugal,1997,1990s,1:37,"The first film in Pedro Costa's transformative trilogy about Fontainhas, an impoverished quarter of Lisbon, OSSOS is a tale of young lives torn apart by desperation. After a suicidal teenage girl gives birth, she misguidedly entrusts her baby's safety to the troubled, deadbeat father, whose violent actions take the viewer on a tour of the foreboding, crumbling shantytown in which they live. With its reserved, shadowy cinematography by Emmanuel Machuel (who collaborated with Bresson on L'argent), OSSOS is a haunting look at a devastated community.",1.62,https://www.criterionchannel.com/ossos
The Other Side of Hope,Aki Kaurismäki,Finland,2017,2010s,1:40,"This wry, melancholic comedy from Aki Kaurismäki, a response to the ongoing global refugee crisis, follows two people searching for a place to call home. Khaled (Sherwan Haji), a displaced Syrian, lands in Helsinki as a stowaway; meanwhile, middle-aged Finnish salesman Wikström (Sakari Kuosmanen) leaves his wife and his job and buys a conspicuously unprofitable restaurant. Khaled is denied asylum but decides not to return to Aleppo, and the paths of the two men cross fortuitously. As deadpan as the best of the director's work, and with a deep well of empathy for its down-but-not-out characters (many of them played by members of Kaurismäki's loyal stock company), THE OTHER SIDE OF HOPE is a bittersweet celebration of pockets of human kindness in an unwelcoming world.",1.67,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-other-side-of-hope

With Tom hot on her trail, Gerry takes off for Florida on a mission to solve the pair’s money troubles, which she accomplishes in a highly unorthodox manner. A mix of the witty and the utterly absurd, THE PALM BEACH STORY is a high-water mark of Sturges’s brand of physical comedy and verbal repartee, featuring sparkling performances from its leads as well as hilarious supporting turns from Rudy Vallee and Mary Astor as a brother and a sister ensnared in Tom and Gerry’s high jinks.",1.47,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-palm-beach-story

And perhaps none of his female stars shone brighter than Kansas native and onetime Ziegfeld girl Louise Brooks, whose legendary persona was defined by Pabst’s lurid, controversial melodrama PANDORA’S BOX. Sensationally modern, the film follows the downward spiral of the fiery, brash, yet innocent showgirl Lulu, whose sexual vivacity has a devastating effect on everyone she comes in contact with.

But after a woman turns up dead in the Paris suburb where he lives, he feels drawn to a pretty young newcomer to town (Viviane Romance), discovers that his neighbors are only too ready to suspect the worst of him, and is framed for the murder. Based on a novel by Georges Simenon, Julien Duvivier’s first film after his return to France from Hollywood finds the acclaimed poetic realist applying his consummate craft to darker, moodier ends.

The film follows a young literature student (Betty Schneider) who befriends the members of a loose-knit group of twentysomethings in Paris, united by the apparent suicide of an acquaintance. Suffused with a lingering post-World War II disillusionment while also evincing the playfulness and fascination with theatrical performance and conspiracy that would become hallmarks for the director, PARIS BELONGS TO US marked the provocative start to a brilliant directorial career.",2.37,https://www.criterionchannel.com/paris-belongs-to-us

Anna Karina (in her first collaboration with Godard, whose camera is visibly besotted with her) is beguiling as the mysterious woman with whom Forestier becomes infatuated. Banned for two and a half years by French censors for its depiction of brutal tactics on the part of the French government and the Algerian fighters alike, LE PETIT SOLDAT finds the young Godard already retooling cinema as a vehicle for existential inquiry, political argument, and ephemeral portraiture—in other words, as a medium for delivering “truth twenty-four times per second.”",1.47,https://www.criterionchannel.com/le-petit-soldat

The story, based on a novel by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf, concerns an alcoholic, abusive ne’er-do-well (Sjöström himself) who is shown the error of his ways, and the pure-of-heart Salvation Army sister who believes in his redemption.

After surviving Auschwitz, a former cabaret singer (Nina Hoss, in a dazzling, multilayered performance) has her disfigured face reconstructed and returns to her war-ravaged hometown to seek out her gentile husband, who may or may not have betrayed her to the Nazis. Without recognizing her, he enlists her to play his wife in a bizarre hall-of-shattered-mirrors story that is as richly metaphorical as it is preposterously engrossing.

Severely repressed, she satisfies her mas­ochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life.

A cornerstone of the career of this most economical and profoundly spiritual of filmmakers, PICKPOCKET is an elegantly crafted, tautly choreographed study of humanity in all its mischief and grace, the work of a director at the height of his powers.",1.27,https://www.criterionchannel.com/pickpocket
Picnic at Hanging Rock,Peter Weir,Australia,1975,1970s,1:47,"This sensual and striking chronicle of a disappearance and its aftermath put director Peter Weir on the map and helped usher in a new era of Australian cinema. Based on an acclaimed 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK is set at the turn of the twentieth century and concerns a small group of students from an all-female college who vanish, along with a chaperone, while on a St. Valentine’s Day outing. Less a mystery than a journey into the mystic, as well as an inquiry into issues of class and sexual repression in Australian society, Weir’s gorgeous, disquieting film is a work of poetic horror whose secrets haunt viewers to this day.",1.78,https://www.criterionchannel.com/picnic-at-hanging-rock
Pierrot le fou,Jean-Luc Godard,France,1965,1960s,1:50,"Dissatisfied in marriage and life, Ferdinand (Jean-Paul Belmondo) takes to the road with the babysitter, his ex-lover Marianne Renoir (Anna Karina), and leaves the bourgeois world behind. Yet this is no normal road trip: genius auteur Jean-Luc Godard’s tenth feature in six years is a stylish mash-up of anticonsumerist satire, au courant politics, and comic-book aesthetics, as well as a violent, zigzag tale of, as Godard called them, “the last romantic couple.” With blissful color imagery by cinematographer Raoul Coutard and Belmondo and Karina at their most animated, PIERROT LE FOU is one of the high points of the French New Wave, and was Godard’s last frolic before he moved ever further into radical cinema.",1.83,https://www.criterionchannel.com/pierrot-le-fou

Shot in gorgeously composed, bustling CinemaScope, the film follows a young couple as they try to navigate Yokosuka’s corrupt businessmen, chimpira, and their own unsure future together.

Pina,Wim Wenders,Germany,2011,2010s,1:43,"The boundless imagination and physical marvels of the work of the German modern-dance pioneer Pina Bausch leap off the screen in this exuberant tribute by Wim Wenders. A long-planned film collaboration between the director and the choreographer was in preproduction when Bausch died in 2009. Two years later, Wenders decided to go ahead with the project, reconceiving it as an homage to his late friend. The result, shot in stunning 3D, is a remarkable visual experience and a vivid representation of Bausch’s art, enacted by a group of staggeringly talented dancers from her company, the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch. PINA is an adventurous work of cinema that highlights the bold legacy of one of the world’s true creative visionaries.",1.72,https://www.criterionchannel.com/pina

Hiroshi Teshigahara’s debut feature and first collaboration with novelist Kobo Abe, PITFALL is many things: a mysterious, unsettling ghost story, a portrait of human alienation, and a compellingly surreal critique of soulless industry, shot in elegant black and white.",1.62,https://www.criterionchannel.com/pitfall
Pixote,Héctor Babenco,Brazil,1980,1980s,2:07,"With its bracing blend of unflinching realism and aching humanity, Héctor Babenco’s electrifying look at lost youth fighting to survive on the bottom rung of Brazilian society helped put the country’s cinema on the international map. Shot with documentary-like immediacy on the streets of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, PIXOTE follows the eponymous preteen runaway (the heartbreaking Fernando Ramos da Silva, whose own too-short life tragically mirrored that of his character) as he escapes a nightmarish juvenile detention center only to descend into a life of increasingly violent crime alongside a makeshift family of fellow outcasts. Balancing its shocking brutality with moments of tenderness, this stunning journey through Brazil’s underworld is an unforgettable cry from the lower depths that has influenced multiple generations of filmmakers, including Spike Lee, Harmony Korine, and the Safdie brothers.",2.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/pixote

The Player,Robert Altman,United States,1992,1990s,2:04,"A Hollywood studio executive with a shaky moral compass (Tim Robbins) finds himself caught up in a criminal situation that would be right at home in one of his movie projects, in this biting industry satire from Robert Altman. Mixing elements of film noir with sly insider comedy, THE PLAYER, based on a novel by Michael Tolkin, functions as both a nifty stylish murder story and a commentary on its own making, and it is stocked with a heroic supporting cast (Peter Gallagher, Whoopi Goldberg, Greta Scacchi, Dean Stockwell, Fred Ward) and a lineup of star cameos that make for an astonishing Hollywood who's who. This complexly woven grand entertainment (which kicks off with one of American cinema's most audacious and acclaimed opening shots) was the film that marked Altman's triumphant commercial comeback in the early 1990s.",2.07,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-player
PlayTime,Jacques Tati,France,1967,1960s,2:04,"Jacques Tati’s gloriously choreographed, nearly wordless comedies about confusion in an age of high technology reached their apotheosis with PLAYTIME. For this monumental achievement, a nearly three-year-long, bank-breaking production, Tati again thrust the lovably old-fashioned Monsieur Hulot, along with a host of other lost souls, into a baffling modern world, this time Paris. With every inch of its superwide frame crammed with hilarity and inventiveness, PLAYTIME is a lasting record of a modern era tiptoeing on the edge of oblivion.",2.07,https://www.criterionchannel.com/playtime
The Pleasure of Love,Nelly Kaplan,France,1991,1990s,1:45,"The final feature directed by Nelly Kaplan is a sly, period-set variation on her signature themes of sex, power, and the relationships between men and women.

Rather than wait for the man to retrieve his money, however, Atsushi decides to spend it all in one libidinous rush, fully expecting to be tracked down and killed.

Yet it has not been released until now. Hired by Russell to film him at his recording studio in northeast Oklahoma, Blank ended up constructing a unique, intimate portrait of a musician and his environment. Made up of mesmerizing scenes of Russell and his band performing, both in concert and in the studio, as well as off-the-cuff moments behind the scenes, this singular film—which also features performances by Willie Nelson and George Jones—has attained legendary status over the years. It’s a work of rough beauty that serves as testament to Blank’s cinematic daring and Russell’s immense musical talents.",1.48,https://www.criterionchannel.com/a-poem-is-a-naked-person

In a tremendously moving performance, Robert Lynen plays the neglected young François, mockingly called Poil de Carotte (Carrottop) by his family for his mop of red hair.

La Pointe Courte,Agnès Varda,France,1955,1950s,1:21,"The great Agnès Varda’s film career began with this graceful, penetrating study of a marriage on the rocks, set against the backdrop of a small Mediterranean fishing village. Both a stylized depiction of the complicated relationship between a married couple (played by Silvia Monfort and Philippe Noiret) and a documentary-like look at the daily struggles of the locals, Varda’s discursive, gorgeously filmed debut was radical enough to later be considered one of the progenitors of the coming French New Wave.",1.35,https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-pointe-courte
La poison ,Sacha Guitry,France,1951,1950s,1:25,"The writer, actor, and director Sacha Guitry emerged from the theater to become one of France’s best-known and most inventive filmmakers, and LA POISON marked his first major collaboration with another titan of the screen, the incomparably expressive Michel Simon. With Guitry’s witty dialogue and fleet pacing, this black comedy is the quintessential depiction of a marriage gone sour: after thirty years together, a village gardener (Simon) and his wife (Germaine Reuver) find themselves contemplating how to do away with each other, with the former even planning how he’ll negotiate his eventual criminal trial. Inspired by Guitry’s own post–World War II tangle with the law—a wrongful charge of collaborationism—LA POISON is a blithely caustic broadside against the French legal system and a society all too eager to capitalize on the misfortunes of others.",1.42,https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-poison

Police Story,Jackie Chan,Hong Kong,1985,1980s,1:40,"The jaw-dropping set pieces fly fast and furious in Jackie Chan’s breathtakingly inventive martial-arts comedy, a smash hit that made him a worldwide icon of daredevil action spectacle. The director/star/one-man stunt machine plays Ka-Kui, a Hong Kong police inspector who goes rogue to bring down a drug kingpin and protect the case’s star witness (Chinese cinema legend Brigitte Lin) from retribution. Packed wall-to-wall with charmingly goofball slapstick and astoundingly acrobatic fight choreography—including an epic shopping-mall melee of flying fists and shattered glass—POLICE STORY set a new standard for rock-’em-sock-’em mayhem that would influence a generation of filmmakers from Hong Kong to Hollywood.",1.67,https://www.criterionchannel.com/police-story

But it isn’t long before he’s back in action, racing the clock to stop a band of serial bombers and win back his much-put-upon girlfriend May (the phenomenal Maggie Cheung, reprising her star-making role). Boasting epic explosions, an awesomely 1980s electro soundtrack, and a showstopping finale—which turns an abandoned warehouse into a life-size pinball machine of cascading oil drums, collapsing scaffolds, and shooting fireworks—POLICE STORY 2 confirmed Chan’s status as a performer of unparalleled grace and daring.",2.03,https://www.criterionchannel.com/police-story-2

They are an aid to a repressed society, and he uses the money to support his landlady, Haru, and her family. From time to time, Haru shares her bed with Subu, though she believes her dead husband, reincarnated as a carp, disapproves. Director Shohei Imamura has always delighted in the kinky exploits of lowlifes, and in this 1966 classic, he finds subversive humor in the bizarre dynamics of Haru, her Oedipal son, and her daughter, the true object of her pornographer-boyfriend’s obsession. Imamura’s comic treatment of such taboos as voyeurism and incest sparked controversy when the film was released, but THE PORNOGRAPHERS has outlasted its critics, and now seems frankly ahead of its time.",2.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-pornographers

Jean-Pierre Gorin's polyphonic nonfiction investigation of this phenomenon looks at the family from a variety of angles, with the director taking on the role of a sort of sociological detective.

Buddy's sister has been arrested in Santa Fe, and together Buddy and Philbert set off on a road trip to look after her kids and go bail her out. However, Bonnie's arrest has something strange about it as her friend Rabbit points out.

He spends his time knocking around with his clothes-obsessed, pill-popping, scooter-driving fellow mods, a group whose antipathy for the motorcycle-riding rockers leads to a climactic riot in Brighton. Director Franc Roddam’s rough-edged film is a quintessential chronicle of youthful rebellion and turmoil, with Pete Townshend’s brilliant songs (including “I’ve Had Enough,” “5:15,” and “Love Reign O’er Me”) providing emotional support, and featuring Sting and Ray Winstone in early roles.",2.0,https://www.criterionchannel.com/quadrophenia
Queen of Diamonds,Nina Menkes,United States,1991,1990s,1:15,"Nina Menkes’s entrancing dream vision of alienation on the margins of Las Vegas is one of the most radical and provocative independent films of the 1990s. Set amid the glittering casino lights and deteriorating desert landscapes of the oasis city, QUEEN OF DIAMONDS revolves around the disaffected existence of of Firdaus (the filmmaker’s sister and frequent collaborator Tinka Menkes), a blackjack dealer whose world unfolds as a fragmented but hypnotic interplay between repetition and repressed anger. Shot with a beautiful compositional rigor that echoes the work of Chantal Akerman, this lost underground masterwork can be appreciated anew thanks to a glimmering restoration by the The Film Foundation and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.",1.25,https://www.criterionchannel.com/queen-of-diamonds
Querelle,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,West Germany,1982,1980s,1:48,"Director Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s final film is a deliriously stylized tale of hothouse lust and simmering violence. Set amid an expressionistic soundstage vision of a French sea port, this daring adaptation of a novel by Jean Genet recounts the tragedy of a handsome sailor (Brad Davis) as he is drawn into a vortex of sibling rivalry, murder, and explosive sexuality. Completed just before Fassbinder’s sudden death at age thirty-seven, QUERELLE finds the director pushing his embrace of artifice and taboo-shattering depiction of queer desire to new extremes.",1.8,https://www.criterionchannel.com/querelle

After undergoing radical emergency surgery, Rose (former adult-film star Marilyn Chambers in her first leading role in a mainstream film) develops an insatiable desire for blood. She searches out and seduces victims to satisfy her incurable craving, infecting them with an unknown disease that swiftly drives them insane . . . and makes them equally bloodthirsty. In its shocking fusion of sexuality and violence, RABID stands as one of the most audacious horror films of the 1970s.",1.5,https://www.criterionchannel.com/rabid

Rashomon,Akira Kurosawa,Japan,1950,1950s,1:28,"A riveting psychological thriller that investigates the nature of truth and the meaning of justice, RASHOMON is widely considered one of the greatest films ever made. Four people give different accounts of a man’s murder and the rape of his wife, which director Akira Kurosawa presents with striking imagery and an ingenious use of flashbacks.

Drawing from his memories of his turbulent, Thatcher-era upbringing in a Midlands council flat and his relationship with his alcoholic mother (Ella Smith) and father (Justin Salinger), he has created a vividly impressionistic immersion into a world of loveless squalor and parental obliviousness—with images of strange beauty and surprising humor that shine through the rampant horror.",1.8,https://www.criterionchannel.com/ray-liz

Red Desert,Michelangelo Antonioni,Italy,1964,1960s,1:57,"Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1960s panoramas of contemporary alienation were decade-defining artistic events, and RED DESERT, his first color film, is perhaps his most epochal. This provocative look at the spiritual desolation of the technological age—about a disaffected woman, brilliantly portrayed by Antonioni muse Monica Vitti, wandering through a bleak industrial landscape beset by power plants and environmental toxins, and tentatively flirting with her husband’s coworker, played by Richard Harris—continues to keep viewers spellbound. With one startling, painterly composition after another—of abandoned fishing cottages, electrical towers, looming docked ships—RED DESERT creates a nearly apocalyptic image of its time, and confirms Antonioni as cinema’s preeminent poet of the modern age.",1.95,https://www.criterionchannel.com/red-desert

Their desperate plans for escape unexpectedly intersect with the lives of a rural cop and his seemingly content wife.

RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11, the brainchild of producer extraordinaire Walter Wanger, is a ripped-from-the-headlines social-problem picture about inmates’ rights that was inspired by a recent spate of uprisings in American prisons. In Siegel’s hands, the film, shot on location at Folsom State Prison, with real inmates and guards as extras, is at once brash and humane, showcasing the hard-boiled visual flair and bold storytelling for which the director would become known.",1.33,https://www.criterionchannel.com/riot-in-cell-block-11

With an operatic Nino Rota score and Giuseppe Rotunno’s glimmering, on-location cinematography, ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS “represents the artistic apotheosis of Italian neorealism,” says A.O.

The film has had a tumultuous history: it was subjected to cuts after the violent response of the premiere audience in 1939, and the original negative was destroyed during World War II; it wasn’t reconstructed until 1959.

Lieutenant Cantrell (Jeffrey Hunter) defends Rutledge as witnesses give testimony (relived in flashbacks) revealing the sergeant’s gallantry—and the shocking truth behind the alleged crimes.

Taken together, they form a piercing portrait of women’s experiences in 1960s Czechoslovakia and a daring first expression of the feminist themes Chytilová would explore in subsequent works like DAISIES.",1.4,https://www.criterionchannel.com/something-different

A Spell to Ward Off the Darkness,Ben Rivers and Ben Russell,France,2013,2010s,1:38,"Less a film in the traditional sense than an incantatory induction into the sublime, this utterly unclassifiable collaboration between boundary-pushing experimentalists Ben Rivers and Ben Russell finds transcendence in the elemental forces of earth, water, and doom metal. Through three episodes, we follow a man (played by musician Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe) in search of present-day utopia, first as a member of a commune on an Estonian island, then alone in the majestic wilderness of northern Finland, and finally as the singer of a neopagan black-metal band in Norway.

It’s the beginning of an extended surveillance operation that gradually reveals as much about the woman they are watching—and the oppressive marriage she is trapped in—as the case they are investigating.

Adapting a science-fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Tarkovsky created an immersive world with a wealth of material detail and a sense of organic atmosphere.

The Steel Helmet,Samuel Fuller,United States,1951,1950s,1:24,"The Steel Helmet marked Samuel Fuller's official arrival as a mighty cinematic force. Despite its relatively low budget, this portrait of Korean War soldiers dealing with moral and racial identity crises remains one of the director's most gripping, realistic depictions of the blood and guts of war, as well as a reflection of Fuller's irreducible social conscience.

Rather than focus on big dramatic moments, Kore-eda relies on simple gestures and domestic routines (especially cooking) to evoke a family’s entire life, its deep regrets and its daily joys.

Drawn from Pierre Louÿs’s 1898 novel “La Femme et le pantin,” THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE is a dizzying game of sexual politics punctuated by a terror that harkens back to Buñuel’s brilliant surrealistic beginnings.",1.73,https://www.criterionchannel.com/that-obscure-object-of-desire
The Bad and the Beautiful,Vincente Minnelli,United States,1952,1950s,1:57,"Appearances are everything in Hollywood. Kirk Douglas gives a magnetic, Oscar-nominated performance as conniving producer Jonathan Shields, who turns talent, charisma and ruthlessness into film success, stomping on careers and creating enemies along the way. Vincente Minnelli directs this winner of five Academy Awards that’s more than a compelling insider’s look at Tinseltown: it’s a juicy opportunity for buffs to guess which real-life stars and moguls inspired the roles played by Douglas, Lana Turner, Walter Pidgeon, Dick Powell, Gloria Grahame, and more.",1.95,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-bad-and-the-beautiful
There Was a Father,Yasujiro Ozu,Japan,1942,1940s,1:27,"Yasujiro Ozu’s frequent leading man Chishu Ryu is riveting as Shuhei, a widowed high school teacher who finds that the more he tries to do what is best for his son’s future, the more they are separated. Though primarily a delicately wrought story of parental love, THERE WAS A FATHER offers themes of sacrifice that were deemed appropriately patriotic by Japanese censors at the time of its release during World War II, making it a uniquely political film in Ozu’s body of work.",1.45,https://www.criterionchannel.com/there-was-a-father
They Live by Night,Nicholas Ray,United States,1948,1940s,1:35,"Legendary director Nicholas Ray began his career with this lyrical film noir, the first in a series of existential genre films overflowing with sympathy for America’s outcasts and underdogs. When the wide-eyed fugitive Bowie (Farley Granger), having broken out of prison with some bank robbers, meets the innocent Keechie (Cathy O’Donnell), each recognizes something in the other that no one else ever has. The young lovers envision a new, decent life together, but as they flee the cops and contend with Bowie’s fellow outlaws, who aren’t about to let him go straight, they realize there’s nowhere left to run. Ray brought an outsider’s sensibility honed in the theater to this debut, using revolutionary camera techniques and naturalistic performances to craft a profoundly romantic crime drama that paved the way for decades of lovers-on-the-run thrillers to come.",1.58,https://www.criterionchannel.com/they-live-by-night
The Thick-Walled Room,Masaki Kobayashi,Japan,1953,1950s,1:50,"Even early on in his directing career, Masaki Kobayashi didn't shy away from controversy. Among the first Japanese films to deal directly with the scars of World War II, this drama about a group of rank-and-file Japanese soldiers jailed for crimes against humanity was adapted from the diaries of real prisoners. Because of its potentially inflammatory content, the film was shelved by the studio for three years before being released.",1.83,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-thick-walled-room

The Thin Blue Line,Errol Morris,United States,1988,1980s,1:41,"Among the most important documentaries ever made, THE THIN BLUE LINE, by Errol Morris, erases the border between art and activism. A work of meticulous journalism and gripping drama, it recounts the disturbing tale of Randall Dale Adams, a drifter who was charged with the murder of a Dallas police officer and sent to death row, despite evidence that he did not commit the crime. Incorporating stylized reenactments, penetrating interviews, and haunting original music by Philip Glass, Morris uses cinema to build a case forensically while effortlessly entertaining his viewers.

The Third Generation,Rainer Werner Fassbinder,West Germany,1979,1970s,1:49,"Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s follow-up to his international breakthrough THE MARRIAGE OF MARIA BRAUN is a wildly anarchic satire of guerrilla terrorism in which a band of leftist radicals inadvertently become puppets of the West German government, which uses them to justify its authoritarian policies.

This Happy Breed,David Lean,United Kingdom,1944,1940s,1:51,"David Lean brings to vivid emotional life Noël Coward’s epic chronicle of a working-class family in the London suburbs over the course of two decades. Robert Newton and Celia Johnson are surpassingly affecting as Frank and Ethel Gibbons, a couple with three children whose modest household is touched by joy and tragedy from the tail end of the First World War to the beginning of the Second.

With an astonishing, raging performance by a young Richard Harris, an equally blistering turn by fellow Oscar nominee Rachel Roberts as the widow with whom he lodges, and electrifying direction by Lindsay Anderson, in his feature-film debut following years of documentary work, THIS SPORTING LIFE remains a dramatic powerhouse.",2.23,https://www.criterionchannel.com/this-sporting-life

But BLUE is more than just a blistering study of grief; it’s also a tale of liberation, as Julie attempts to free herself from the past while confronting truths about the life of her late husband, a composer. Shot in sapphire tones by Sławomir Idziak, and set to an extraordinary operatic score by Zbigniew Preisner, BLUE is an overwhelming sensory experience.",1.63,https://www.criterionchannel.com/three-colors-blue
Three Colors: Red,Krzysztof Kieślowski,France,1994,1990s,1:39,"Krzysztof Kieślowski closes his Three Colors trilogy in grand fashion, with an incandescent meditation on fate and chance, starring Irène Jacob as a sweet-souled yet somber runway model in Geneva whose life dramatically intersects with that of a bitter retired judge, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant.

Three Outlaw Samurai,Hideo Gosha,Japan,1964,1960s,1:33,"This first feature by the legendary Hideo Gosha is among the most beloved chanbara (sword-fighting) films. An origin-story offshoot of a Japanese television phenomenon of the same name, THREE OUTLAW SAMURAI is a classic in its own right. A wandering, seen-it-all ronin (Tetsuro Tamba) becomes entangled in the dangerous business of two other samurai (Isamu Nagato and Mikijiro Hira), hired to execute a band of peasants who have kidnapped the daughter of a corrupt magistrate.

Set in the impoverished back alleys of Victorian London, THE THREEPENNY OPERA follows underworld antihero Mackie Messer (a.k.a.

Throne of Blood,Akira Kurosawa,Japan,1957,1950s,1:49,"A vivid, visceral “Macbeth” adaptation, THRONE OF BLOOD, directed by Akira Kurosawa, sets Shakespeare’s definitive tale of ambition and duplicity in a ghostly, fog-enshrouded landscape in feudal Japan.

Through the Olive Trees,Abbas Kiarostami,Iran,1994,1990s,1:43,"Abbas Kiarostami takes metanarrative gamesmanship to masterful new heights in the final installment of THE KOKER TRILOGY. Unfolding “behind the scenes” of AND LIFE GOES ON, this film traces the complications that arise when the romantic misfortune of one of the actors—a young man who pines for the woman cast as his wife, even though, in real life, she will have nothing to do with him—creates turmoil on set and leaves the hapless director caught in the middle. An ineffably lovely, gentle human comedy steeped in the folkways of Iranian village life, THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES peels away layer after layer of artifice as it investigates the elusive, alchemical relationship between cinema and reality.",1.72,https://www.criterionchannel.com/through-the-olive-trees

The Oscar-winning THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK, directed by Robert Epstein and produced by Richard Schmiechen, was as groundbreaking as its subject. One of the first feature documentaries to address gay life in America, it’s a work of advocacy itself, bringing Milk’s message of hope and equality to a wider audience. This exhilarating trove of original documentary material and archival footage is as much a vivid portrait of a time and place (San Francisco’s historic Castro District in the seventies) as a testament to the legacy of a political visionary.",1.47,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-times-of-harvey-milk

While the chaotic world around him careens toward the madness and folly of World War II, Oskar pounds incessantly on his beloved tin drum and perfects his uncannily piercing shrieks. THE TIN DRUM, which earned the Palme d’Or at Cannes and the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, is Volker Schlöndorff’s visionary adaptation of Nobel laureate Günter Grass’ acclaimed novel, characterized by surreal imagery, arresting eroticism, and clear-eyed satire.",2.72,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-tin-drum
Tiny Furniture,Lena Dunham,United States,2010,2010s,1:39,"Lena Dunham got her start making YouTube videos, but she emerged as a major talent thanks to the breakthrough success of this exceptionally sharp comedy, which garnered the twenty-four-year-old writer-director-actor comparisons to the likes of Woody Allen. Dunham plays Aura, a recent college graduate who returns to New York and moves back in with her mother and sister (played by the filmmaker’s real-life mother and sister).

Interweaving three decades’ worth of Mark’s photographs and footage that includes previously unseen outtakes from STREETWISE, this is a heartrending, deeply empathetic portrait of a family struggling to break free of the cycle of trauma, as well as a summation of the life’s work of Mark, an irreplaceable artistic voice.",1.47,https://www.criterionchannel.com/tiny-the-life-of-erin-blackwell

TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a Hollywood film of the boldest black humor, which went into production soon after the U.S. entered World War II.

Tokyo Olympiad,Kon Ichikawa,Japan,1965,1960s,2:50,"A spectacle of magnificent proportions and remarkable intimacy, Kon Ichikawa’s TOKYO OLYMPIAD remains one of the greatest films ever made about sports. Supervising a vast team of technicians using scores of cameras, Ichikawa captured the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo in glorious widescreen images, using cutting-edge telephoto lenses and exquisite slow motion to create lyrical, idiosyncratic poetry from the athletic drama surging all around him. Drawn equally to the psychology of losers and winners—including the legendary Ethiopian marathoner Abebe Bikila, who receives the film’s most exalted tribute—Ichikawa captures the triumph, passion, and suffering of competition with a singular humanistic vision, and in doing so effected a transformative influence on the art of documentary filmmaking.",2.83,https://www.criterionchannel.com/tokyo-olympiad

TOM JONES brings a theatrical flair to Henry Fielding’s canonical eighteenth-century novel, boisterously chronicling the misadventures of the foundling of the title (Albert Finney, in a career-defining performance), whose easy charm seems to lead him astray at every turn from his beloved, the wellborn Sophie Western (Susannah York). This spirited picaresque, evocatively shot in England’s rambling countryside and featuring an extraordinary ensemble cast, went on to become a worldwide sensation, winning the Oscar for best picture on the way to securing its status as a classic of irreverent wit and playful cinematic expression.",2.02,https://www.criterionchannel.com/tom-jones

The sanctuary she and her three companions find with a shy scholar is shattered when a nefarious swordsman uncovers her identity, pitting the five against legions of blade-wielding opponents.

In this French New Wave-influenced fantasy-drama, two young lovers long to leave Dakar for the glamour and comforts of France, but their escape plan is beset by complications both concrete and mystical. Characterized by dazzling imagery and music, the alternately manic and meditative TOUKI BOUKI is widely considered one of the most important African films ever made.",1.5,https://www.criterionchannel.com/touki-bouki

This free-ranging assault on consumer capitalism and the establishment left tells the story of a wildcat strike at a sausage factory as witnessed by an American reporter (Fonda) and her has-been New Wave film director husband (Yves Montand).

Part intellectual death match, part three-ring circus, the proceedings were captured with crackling, fly-on-the-wall immediacy by the documentary great D. A. Pennebaker and a small crew, with Chris Hegedus later condensing the three-and-a-half-hour affair into this briskly entertaining snapshot of a singular cultural moment. Heady, heated, and hilarious, TOWN BLOODY HALL is a dazzling display of feminist firepower courtesy of some of the most influential figures of the era, with Mailer plainly relishing his role as the pugnacious rabble-rouser and literary lion at the center of it all.",1.42,https://www.criterionchannel.com/town-bloody-hall

In this, his final outing, Hulot is employed as an auto company’s director of design, and accompanies his new product (a “camping car” outfitted with absurd gadgetry) to an auto show in Amsterdam. Naturally, the road there is paved with modern-age mishaps.

Filming on an abandoned farm for four months, Olmi adapted neorealist techniques to tell his story, enlisting local people to live as their own ancestors had, speaking in their native dialect on locations with which they were intimately familiar. Through the cycle of seasons, of backbreaking labor, love and marriage, birth and death, faith and superstition, Olmi naturalistically evokes an existence very close to nature, celebrating its beauty, humor, and simplicity but also acknowledging the feudal cruelty that governs it.

With Florence Delay as the martyred saint, in a presentation intended to make her accessible to modern younger viewers, the result was somewhere between a legitimate hagiographical film and the precursor to Zeffirelli's youth-oriented Romeo & Juliet, made a half-decade later.",1.07,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-trial-of-joan-of-arc

But his romantic vacillation between a British soldier and a French nurse, exacerbated by a fetishistic obsession, may well bring about his downfall. In his quest for power, King must gratify the expectations of his imperious mother, the hawkish fantasies of a warmongering governor-general, and the utopian idealism of a Quebecois mystic before facing a final test of leadership.

Homecoming queen by day and drug-addicted thrill seeker by night, Laura leads a double life that pulls her deeper and deeper into horror as she pieces together the identity of the assailant who has been terrorizing her for years.

As with many of Truffaut's best works (of which this is one, though it is often underrated), the story, of the romantic triangle between the two title characters and Léaud's Claude, is so beautifully delineated that the tale becomes almost secondary to its telling.",2.17,https://www.criterionchannel.com/two-english-girls

Victim,Basil Dearden,United Kingdom,1961,1960s,1:40,"An extraordinary performance by Dirk Bogarde grounds this intense, sobering indictment of early-sixties social intolerance and sexual puritanism. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married barrister who is one of a large group of closeted London men who become targets of a blackmailer. Basil Dearden's unmistakably political taboo buster was one of the first films to address homophobia head-on, a cry of protest against British laws forbidding homosexuality.",1.67,https://www.criterionchannel.com/victim
Victoria,Sebastian Schipper,Germany,2015,2010s,2:18,"Shot in a stunning single take, VICTORIA is a breathless plunge into Berlin’s dark underbelly. Victoria (Laia Costa), a young Spanish woman who has recently moved to Berlin, is out late partying at an underground club when she meets four men who invite her along with them as they carouse their way across city. It’s the beginning of a long night’s journey into day that soon takes a disturbing turn as hedonistic thrill-chasing gives way to something far more dangerous.",2.3,https://www.criterionchannel.com/victoria
La vie de bohème,Aki Kaurismäki,Finland,1992,1990s,1:42,"This deadpan tragicomedy about a group of impoverished, outcast artists living the bohemian life in Paris is among the most beguiling films by Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki. Based on stories from Henri Murger’s influential mid-nineteenth-century book “Scènes de la vie de bohème” (the basis for the opera “La bohème”), the film features a marvelous trio of Kaurismäki regulars—André Wilms, Matti Pellonpää, and Karl Väänänen—as a writer, painter, and composer who scrape by together, sharing in life’s daily absurdities. Gorgeously shot in black and white, LA VIE DE BOHÈME is a vibrantly scrappy rendition of a beloved tale.",1.7,https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-vie-de-boheme
La vie de Jésus,Bruno Dumont,France,1997,1990s,1:36,"With his stunning debut feature, the risk-taking auteur Bruno Dumont immediately established his reputation as an uncompromising iconoclast on the cutting edge of French cinema. Blending unflinching realism with moments of startling, light-filled beauty, LA VIE DE JÉSUS finds unexpected philosophical richness in the quotidian, small-town existence of Freddy (nonprofessional David Douche in a revelatory, one-off performance), an aimless young man with epilepsy who, in his childlike simplicity, embodies both great tenderness and terrifying brutality. Leaving the film’s cryptic title tantalizingly open to interpretation, Dumont dares viewers to see the divine in a seemingly dead-end world.",1.6,https://www.criterionchannel.com/la-vie-de-jesus
Violence at Noon,Nagisa Oshima,Japan,1966,1960s,1:39,"Violence at Noon concerns the odd circumstances surrounding a horrific murder and rape spree. In a twist, the film is as much about the two women who protect the violent man, his wife and a former victim, as it is about him. Containing more than two thousand cuts and a wealth of inventive widescreen compositions, this coolly fragmented character study is a mesmerizing investigation of criminality and social decay.",1.65,https://www.criterionchannel.com/violence-at-noon
The Virgin Spring,Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1960,1960s,1:29,"Winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, Ingmar Bergman’s THE VIRGIN SPRING is a harrowing tale of faith, revenge, and savagery in medieval Sweden. With austere simplicity, the director tells the story of the rape and murder of the virgin Karin, and her father Töre’s ruthless pursuit of vengeance against the three killers. Starring Max von Sydow and photographed by the brilliant Sven Nykvist, the film is both beautiful and cruel in its depiction of a world teetering between paganism and Christianity.",1.48,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-virgin-spring
Viridiana,Luis Buñuel,Spain,1961,1960s,1:31,"Banned in Spain and denounced by the Vatican, Luis Buñuel’s irreverent vision of life as a beggar’s banquet is regarded by many as his masterpiece. In it, novice nun Viridiana does her utmost to maintain her Catholic principles, but her lecherous uncle and a motley assemblage of paupers force her to confront the limits of her idealism. Winner of the Palme d’or at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival, VIRIDIANA is as audacious today as ever.",1.52,https://www.criterionchannel.com/viridiana
Vision: From the Life of Hildegard von Bingen,Margarethe von Trotta,Germany,2009,2000s,1:50,"Hildegard von Bingen was truly a woman ahead of her time. A visionary in every sense of the word, this famed twelfth-century Benedictine nun was a Christian mystic, composer, philosopher, playwright, poet, naturalist, scientist, physician, herbalist, and ecological activist. In VISION, director Margarethe von Trotta reunites with recurrent star Barbara Sukowa to bring the story of this extraordinary woman to life. In a masterful performance, Sukowa portrays von Bingen’s fierce determination to expand the responsibilities of women within the order, even as she fends off outrage over the visions she claims to receive from God. Lushly shot in the original medieval cloisters of the German countryside, VISION is a profoundly inspirational portrait of a woman who has emerged from the shadows of history as a forward-thinking and iconoclastic pioneer of faith, change, and enlightenment.",1.83,https://www.criterionchannel.com/vision-from-the-life-of-hildegard-von-bingen
Vision Portraits,Rodney Evans,Germany,2019,2010s,1:18,"Rodney Evans’s deeply personal documentary explores how his own partial loss of vision may impact his creative future and what it means to be a blind or visually impaired artist. It’s a celebration of the possibilities of art, as created by a Manhattan photographer (John Dugdale), a Bronx-based dancer (Kayla Hamilton), a Canadian writer (Ryan Knighton), and the filmmaker himself, each of whom works in the face of varying degrees of visual impairment. Interweaving interviews with observational footage of the artists at work, Evans creates a profound meditation on sight and inner vision, a richly sensorial work that opens our minds to a new understanding of the creative process.",1.3,https://www.criterionchannel.com/vision-portraits

Les visiteurs du soir,Marcel Carné,France,1942,1940s,2:01,"A work of poetry and dark humor, LES VISITEURS DU SOIR is a lyrical medieval fantasy from the great French director Marcel Carné. Two strangers dressed as minstrels (Arletty and Alain Cuny) arrive at a castle in advance of court festivities—and are revealed to be emissaries of the devil, dispatched to spread heartbreak and suffering. Their plans, however, are thwarted by an unexpected intrusion: human love. Often interpreted as an allegory for the Nazi occupation of France, during which it was made, LES VISITEURS DU SOIR—wittily written by Jacques Prévert and Pierre Laroche, and elegantly designed by Alexandre Trauner and shot by Roger Hubert—is a moving tale of love conquering all.",2.02,https://www.criterionchannel.com/les-visiteurs-du-soir

With biting humor and poignant human insight, director Antonio Pietrangeli traces twenty-four hours in the lives of these two hopeful lovebirds as they meet for the first time and find that, when it comes to love, reality doesn’t always measure up to fantasy.",1.83,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-visitor
Vitalina Varela,Pedro Costa,Portugal,2019,2010s,2:09,"A work of deeply concentrated beauty, the latest film from Portuguese master Pedro Costa stars nonprofessional actor Vitalina Varela in an extraordinary performance based on her own life. She plays a Cape Verdean woman who, after two decades of separation, travels to Lisbon to reunite with her husband—only to arrive mere days after his funeral. Alone in a strange, forbidding land, Vitalina perseveres and begins to establish a new life. Winner of the Golden Leopard for best film and best actress at the Locarno Film Festival, VITALINA VARELA is a tour de force of shadow and whisper, a ravishing visual experience and a profoundly moving tale of human endurance.",2.15,https://www.criterionchannel.com/vitalina-varela
Vivre sa vie,Jean-Luc Godard,France,1962,1960s,1:23,"Vivre sa vie was a turning point for Jean-Luc Godard and remains one of his most dynamic films, combining brilliant visual design with a tragic character study. The lovely Anna Karina, Godard's greatest muse, plays Nana, a young Parisian who aspires to be an actress but instead ends up a prostitute, her downward spiral depicted in a series of discrete tableaux of daydreams and dances. Featuring some of Karina and Godard's most iconic moments, from her movie theater vigil with The Passion of Joan of Arc to her seductive pool-hall strut, Vivre sa vie is a landmark of the French New Wave that still surprises at every turn.",1.38,https://www.criterionchannel.com/vivre-sa-vie
The Wages of Fear,Henri-Georges Clouzot,France,1953,1950s,2:28,"In a squalid South American oil town, four desperate men sign on for a suicide mission to drive trucks loaded with nitroglycerin over a treacherous mountain route. As they ferry their explosive cargo to a faraway oil fire, each bump and jolt tests their courage, their friendship, and their nerves. The result is one of the greatest thrillers ever committed to celluloid, a white-knuckle ride from France’s legendary master of suspense, Henri-Georges Clouzot.",2.47,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-wages-of-fear
Waiting Women,Ingmar Bergman,Sweden,1952,1950s,1:48,"While at a summerhouse, awaiting their husbands’ return, a group of sisters-in-law recount stories from their respective marriages. Rakel (Anita Björk) tells of receiving a visit from a former lover (Jarl Kulle); Marta (Maj-Britt Nilsson) of agreeing to marry a painter (Birger Malmsten) only after having his child; and Karin (Eva Dahlbeck) of being stuck with her husband (Gunnar Björnstrand) in an elevator, where they talk intimately for the first time in years. Making dexterous use of flashbacks, the engaging WAITING WOMEN is a veritable seedbed of Ingmar Bergman themes, ranging from aspiring young love to the fear of loneliness, with the finale a masterpiece of chamber comedy.",1.8,https://www.criterionchannel.com/waiting-women
Walkabout,Nicolas Roeg,United Kingdom,1971,1970s,1:40,"A young sister and brother are abandoned in the harsh Australian outback and must learn to cope in the natural world, without their usual comforts, in this hypnotic masterpiece from Nicolas Roeg. Along the way, they meet a young aborigine on his “walkabout,” a rite of passage in which adolescent boys are initiated into manhood by journeying into the wilderness alone.

Walk on the Wild Side,Edward Dmytryk,United States,1962,1960s,1:53,"One of Saul Bass’s most iconic title sequences—in which a black cat slinks through a gritty urban nightscape—sets the lurid tone for this deliriously entertaining hothouse melodrama based on Nelson Algren’s explosive novel. In the midst of the Great Depression, Dove Linkhorn (Lawrence Harvey) sets out from Texas to New Orleans in search of his lost love, Hallie (Capucine). Little does he know that she has become the prized attraction at the Doll House Cafe, a notorious bordello ruled with icy authority by the possessive madam Jo Courtney (Barbara Stanwyck), who will do anything to keep Hallie for herself.

Wanda,Barbara Loden,United States,1970,1970s,1:43,"With her first and only feature film—a hard-luck drama she wrote, directed, and starred in—Barbara Loden turned in a groundbreaking work of American independent cinema, bringing to life a kind of character seldom seen on-screen. Set amid a soot-choked Pennsylvania landscape, and shot in an intensely intimate vérité style, the film takes up with distant and soft-spoken Wanda (Loden), who has left her husband, lost custody of her children, and now finds herself alone, drifting between dingy bars and motels, where she falls prey to a series of callous men—including a bank robber who ropes her into his next criminal scheme. An until now difficult-to-see masterpiece that has nonetheless exerted an outsize influence on generations of artists and filmmakers, WANDA is a compassionate and wrenching portrait of a woman stranded on society’s margins.",1.72,https://www.criterionchannel.com/wanda

Shot through with the same kind of bebop bravado that Godard was experimenting with half a world away, the anarchic descent into amoral madness that is The Warped Ones (Kyonetsu no kisetsu) sounded a lost generation's cry for help and was one of the films that kicked off Japan's cinematic sixties with a bang.",1.25,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-warped-ones

The War Room,Chris Hegedus…,United States,1993,1990s,1:36,"The 1992 presidential election was a triumph not only for Bill Clinton but also for the new breed of strategists who guided him to the White House—and changed the face of politics in the process. For this thrilling, behind-closed-doors account of that campaign, renowned cinema verité filmmakers Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker captured the brainstorming and bull sessions of Clinton’s crack team of consultants—especially James Carville and George Stephanopoulos, who became media stars in their own right as they injected a savvy, youthful spirit and spontaneity into the process of campaigning. Fleet-footed and entertaining, THE WAR ROOM is a vivid document of a political moment whose truths (“It’s the economy, stupid!”) still ring in our ears.",1.6,https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-war-room

Watership Down,Martin Rosen,United States,1978,1970s,1:32,"With this passion project, screenwriter-producer-director Martin Rosen brilliantly achieved what had been thought nearly impossible: a faithful big-screen adaptation of Richard Adams’s classic British dystopian novel about a community of rabbits under terrible threat from modern forces. With its naturalistic hand-drawn animation, dreamily expressionistic touches, gorgeously bucolic background design, and elegant voice work from such superb English actors as John Hurt, Ralph Richardson, Richard Briers, and Denholm Elliott, WATERSHIP DOWN is an emotionally arresting, dark-toned allegory about freedom amid political turmoil.",1.53,https://www.criterionchannel.com/watership-down

Rarely has a film been as honest about sexuality—in both depiction and discussion—as this tale of a one-night stand that develops into a weekend-long idyll for two very different young men (exciting screen newcomers Tom Cullen and Chris New) in the English Midlands.

Nevertheless, it was largely dismissed upon its release by critics unable to see the urgency in its evocation of a gritty dystopia in which Black people have been relegated to living in a slum called the Terrordome, where simmering racial tension threatens to boil over in the wake of a young boy’s death. Twenty-five years later, Onwurah’s fusion of political commentary and genre spectacle looks positively prescient, and her ability to build an entire cosmology that connects the history of slavery to present-day police brutality is nothing less than visionary.",1.5,https://www.criterionchannel.com/welcome-ii-the-terrordome

Digging into the trenches with four infantrymen stationed in France in the final months of World War I, Pabst illustrates the harrowing ordeals of battle with unprecedented naturalism, as the men are worn away in body and spirit by firefights, shelling, and the disillusion that greets them on the home front.

Sly, resourceful, but trapped, Keiko comes to embody the conflicts and struggles of a woman trying to establish her independence in a male-dominated society.

Director Giorgio Ferroni knows how to film the key disciplines, even if they are far removed from his specialties, the sword- and-sandal and pulp fiction genres.

Opening and closing with the same sequence of the husband silently leaving home, the real focus of the story -- as with more Naruse films -- is the wife, who decides to take desperate measures to try and hold her marriage together, including foresaking her accepted obligations. The result is a drama with some near-comical, battle-of-the-sexes type overtones that are unusual for Naruse, though the tone is still rooted in domestic tragedy and the message seems to be a wider-ranging one concerning the stresses of life in postwar Japan.",1.6,https://www.criterionchannel.com/wife

When he is asked to assuage a troubled parishioner’s (Max von Sydow) debilitating fear of nuclear annihilation, Tomas is terrified to find that he can provide nothing but his own doubt.

Molly (Millie Perkins) experiences violent fantasies in which she ties muscular men up before bloodily dispatching them with a razor. But when a news report announces the shocking double murder of two football players, which strongly echoes one of Molly’s most recent depraved flights of fancy, the fantasy starts to bleed into reality.

In the course of navigating the racial politics of both the black and white communities, Sylvia’s past is revealed in a series of flashbacks that contain the film’s most notorious sequence: the lynching of her parents by a white mob. Micheaux’s staging of the scene is startling in its bluntness and speaks volumes about the director’s fearlessness and willingness to address taboo subject matter. The film touches upon other themes that would recur throughout the controversial filmmaker’s career, such as the promise of rural life vs. the corrupting influence of the city, and the use of religion as a means of misleading the black community.",1.22,https://www.criterionchannel.com/within-our-gates

When he misses his bus back to civilization, he is persuaded to spend the night with a young widow (Kyoko Kishida) in her hut at the bottom of a sand dune.

Adapted from Robert Musil’s acclaimed novel, YOUNG TÖRLESS launched the New German Cinema movement and garnered the 1966 Cannes Film Festival International Critics’ Prize for first-time director Volker Schlöndorff.",1.45,https://www.criterionchannel.com/young-torless
You Only Live Once,Fritz Lang,United States,1937,1930s,1:25,"Fritz Lang brings his bitterly ironic fatalism to this prototypical couple-on-the-run crime drama and key forerunner of film noir. Ex-con Eddie Taylor (Henry Fonda) is a career criminal struggling to start a new, honest life with his sympathetic wife, Joan (Sylvia Sidney).

Youth of the Beast,Seijun Suzuki,Japan,1963,1960s,1:31,"When a mysterious stranger muscles into two rival yakuza gangs, Tokyo’s underworld explodes with violence. YOUTH OF THE BEAST (YAJU NO SEISHUN) was a breakthrough for director Seijun Suzuki, introducing the flamboyant colors, hallucinatory images, and striking compositions that would become his trademark.

Yoyo,Pierre Etaix,France,1965,1960s,1:38,"This elaborately conceived and brilliantly mounted comedy is Pierre Etaix’s most beloved movie, as well as his personal favorite. Beginning as a clever homage to silent film, complete with intertitles, YOYO blossoms into a poignant family saga (in which Etaix plays both a father and his grown son) and a celebration of the circus Etaix adored. Chock-full of nimble sight gags and ingenious sound effects, YOYO is very sweet, a little bit melancholy, and wholly imaginative.",1.63,https://www.criterionchannel.com/yoyo
Y tu mamá también ,Alfonso Cuarón,Mexico,2001,2000s,1:45,"This smash road comedy from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón is that rare movie to combine raunchy subject matter and emotional warmth. Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna shot to international stardom as a pair of horny Mexico City teenagers from different classes who, after their girlfriends jet off to Italy for the summer, are bewitched by a gorgeous older Spanish woman (Maribel Verdú) they meet at a wedding. When she agrees to accompany them on a trip to a faraway beach, the three form an increasingly intense and sensual alliance that ultimately strips them both physically and emotionally bare. Shot with elegance and dexterity by the great Emmanuel Lubezki, Y TU MAMÁ TAMBIÉN is a funny and moving look at human desire.",1.75,https://www.criterionchannel.com/y-tu-mama-tambien
Z,Costa-Gavras,Greece,1969,1960s,2:07,"A pulse-pounding political thriller, Greek expatriate director Costa-Gavras’s Z was one of the cinematic sensations of the late sixties, and remains among the most vital dispatches from that hallowed era of filmmaking. This Academy Award winner—loosely based on the 1963 assassination of Greek left-wing activist Gregoris Lambrakis—stars Yves Montand as a prominent politician and doctor whose public murder amid a violent demonstration is covered up by military and government officials; Jean-Louis Trintignant is the tenacious magistrate who’s determined not to let them get away with it. Featuring kinetic, rhythmic editing, Raoul Coutard’s expressive vérité photography, and Mikis Theodorakis’s unforgettable, propulsive score, Z is a technically audacious and emotionally gripping masterpiece.",2.12,https://www.criterionchannel.com/z-1
Zazie dans le métro,Louis Malle,France,1960,1960s,1:32,"A brash and precocious ten-year-old (Catherine Demongeot) comes to Paris for a whirlwind weekend with her rakish uncle (Philippe Noiret); he and the viewer get more than they bargained for, however, in this anarchic comedy from Louis Malle, which rides roughshod over the City of Light. Based on a popular novel by Raymond Queneau that had been considered unadaptable, Malle’s audacious ZAZIE DANS LE MÉTRO, made with flair on the cusp of the French New Wave, is a bit of stream-of-consciousness slapstick, wall-to-wall with visual gags, editing tricks, and effects.",1.53,https://www.criterionchannel.com/zazie-dans-le-metro
Zero Focus,Yoshitaro Nomura,Japan,1961,1960s,1:35,"After her husband disappears on a business trip, newlywed Teiko (Yoshiko Kuga) realizes she knows very little about the man she has been married to for only a week. With a pair of mysterious photographs as her only possible clues, she begins an investigation into his whereabouts that leads her down a twisty rabbit hole of intrigue and shocking revelations. One of several stylishly moody thrillers adapted by director Yoshitaro Nomura from the work of master mystery writer Seicho Matsumoto, ZERO FOCUS unfolds in a labyrinthine flashback structure as it winds its way towards its delirious climax.",1.58,https://www.criterionchannel.com/zero-focus
Zombi Child,Bertrand Bonello,France,2019,2010s,1:43,"Iconoclastic auteur Bertrand Bonello blends voodoo, postcolonial tensions, and the spirit of Jacques Tourneur and Val Lewton to create a shivery, hypnotic excursion into heady horror. Haiti, 1962: a man (Mackenson Bijou) is brought back from the dead only to be sent to the living hell of the sugarcane fields. Fifty-five years later in Paris, at a prestigious all-girls boarding school, Melissa (Wislanda Louimat), a young Haitian teenager, confesses an old family secret to a group of new friends—never imagining that this strange tale will convince a heartbroken classmate to do the unthinkable. Displaying the same audaciousness he did in Saint Laurent and Nocturama, Bonello shifts seamlessly between eras, weaving a spellbinding vision of the ways in which colonialism’s legacy continues to haunt the present.",1.72,https://www.criterionchannel.com/zombi-child
