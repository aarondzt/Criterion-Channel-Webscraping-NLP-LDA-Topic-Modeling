Description
"In 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER (2 OU 3 CHOSES QUE JE SAIS D’ELLE), Jean-Luc Godard beckons us ever closer, whispering in our ears as narrator. About what? Money, sex, fashion, the city, love, language, war: in a word, everything. Among the legendary French filmmaker’s finest achievements, the film takes as its ostensible subject the daily life of Juliette Janson (Marina Vlady), a housewife from the Paris suburbs who prostitutes herself for extra money. Yet this is only a template for Godard to spin off into provocative philosophical tangents and gorgeous images. 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER is perhaps Godard’s most revelatory look at consumer culture, shot in ravishing widescreen color by Raoul Coutard."
"A billowing pink dress transports a stouthearted teenage girl from her farm into an anti-Cinderella fairy tale in this feminist fantasy, shot in part on Agnès Varda’s beloved home street, Paris’s rue Daguerre."
"Iranian master Jafar Panahi’s fourth feature since he was officially banned from filmmaking is a courageous act of antipatriarchal defiance from an artist who has refused to be silenced. This playful docufiction road movie begins with a smartphone video sent to the director and real-life star actress Behnaz Jafari from a desperate young woman who, distraught at her family’s refusal to let her study drama, seemingly records her own suicide. Traveling to the woman’s rural hometown to investigate, Panahi and Jafari find themselves launched on a slyly comic, quietly revelatory journey that builds in narrative, thematic, and visual intricacy to put forth a grand expression of community and solidarity under the eye of oppression."
"Romanian filmmaker Cristian Mungiu shot to international prominence with this rigorously realistic Palme d’Or–winning second feature. In 1987, during the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu, college roommates Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) and Găbița (Laura Vasiliu) seek an illegal abortion for Găbița. In unflinching but empathetic detail, the film recounts the events of twenty-four perilous hours in their lives, culminating in their encounter with a manipulative and menacing abortionist (Vlad Ivanov). With powerful performances that accentuate the characters’ flawed humanity, 4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS is a gutting account of the impossible choices women face when taking control of their bodies means breaking the law."
"One of the most outrageous acts of cinematic surrealism ever to emanate from Hollywood’s dream factory, the only film written by Theodor Seuss Geisel (a.k.a. Dr. Seuss) is a riotous Technicolor fantasy in which a young boy (Tommy Rettig) dreams himself into an imaginary world ruled by a diabolical piano teacher (Hans Conried) who forces five hundred children to practice an enormous keyboard for eternity. With its outlandish sets, eccentric musical numbers (with lyrics also penned by Dr. Seuss), and vaguely unsettling tone, THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T. was met with incomprehension upon its release but has since taken its place as a beloved cult favorite, a one-of-a-kind children’s film that doubles as a triumph of genuine avant-garde imagination."
"François Ozon tracks five key episodes in a couple’s disintegrating marriage—beginning with the end of the affair. Starting with their divorce and moving backwards toward their first meeting, 5X2 examines the milestones—from intimations of infidelity to the birth of their son to their wedding day—that sound the death knell of the relationship between ordinary middle-class couple Gilles (Stéphane Freiss) and Marion (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi). Working in a style at once coolly detached and painfully intimate, Ozon offers penetrating insight into the moments, both big and small, that make—and break—a marriage."
"Director Tancred Ibsen's penchant for depicting rustic life shines through in the bucolic scenes at the start of THE VI OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES, OSLO 1952. In addition to the exciting scenes of competition (Winter sports are followed with almost rabid fervor in Scandinavia), Ibsen records a sense of community spirit shared among the competitors."
An ensemble performs a bizarre parody of domesticity at an abandoned Avignon hospice center in this richly surrealist experimental work.
"Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido Anselmi, a director whose new project is collapsing around him, along with his life. One of the greatest films about film ever made, Federico Fellini’s 8½ (Otto e mezzo) turns one man’s artistic crisis into a grand epic of the cinema. An early working title for 8½ was THE BEAUTIFUL CONFUSION, and Fellini’s masterpiece is exactly that: a shimmering dream, a circus, and a magic act."
"This haunting meditation on the the European refugee crisis surveys the Greek island of Lesbos, where thousands of life jackets have washed ashore to create an otherworldly landscape that silently conveys the devastating magnitude of a humanitarian tragedy."
"Made by Istituto Luce, the Italian film company controlled by Benito Mussolini since 1925, THE IX OLYMPIAD IN AMSTERDAM may, understandably, highlight Italian participants, but it is the first Olympic documentary that describes the techniques of certain events with useful particulars."
"Joy and good humor pervades Theo Hörmann's documentary record of the 1964 Games in Austria. Shot in Agfacolor, it nurtures a folkloric image of Tyrol, with its quaint mountain farms and obligatory yodeling. Hörmann deploys shots from a helicopter to present the landscape of Tyrol but also to show the skills of the athletes."
"Meet the 12 O’Clock Boys, an infamous urban dirt-bike pack who whiz through the streets of Baltimore. Popping wheelies and weaving at excessive speeds through traffic, the group impressively evades the hamstrung police. Three years in the making, Lotfy Nathan’s wild, dynamic documentary captures their death-defying antics through the eyes of young adolescent Pug, a bright kid from the Westside obsessed with the riders and willing to do anything to join their ranks. Propelled by breathtakingly kinetic footage that takes viewers along for the ride, 12 O’CLOCK BOYS spins a compelling, intimate story of a young boy and his dangerous, thrilling dream."
"13 DAYS IN FRANCE, a personal project for French filmmaker Claude Lelouch, approaches the X Olympic Winter Games in a radical way, ignoring certain disciplines and dwelling on others. This impressionistic kaleidoscope of a movie manages to be both freewheeling and intimate. Under the direction of Lelouch and François Reichenbach, 13 DAYS IN FRANCE pulses with the insouciant spirit of the sixties and the carefree cinematography and editing pioneered by the French New Wave."
"The official film of the Games of the XIV Olympiad London 1948 is the first in color and seeks to comprise both the winter and summer events from that year. The coverage of the sports cannot be faulted, as cinematographer Stanley Sayer marshaled his team of cameramen with a keen eye and deft precision."
"Director Bud Greenspan, whose career covering sporting events had begun some twenty years earlier, seized the opportunity to helm the official film of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics with such gusto that he would become the IOC's go-to person for Olympic movies. And this 284-minute record of the 1984 Games set the tone for his nine Olympic films to come. 16 DAYS OF GLORY is audacious and fresh and springs from a fascination with the energy and ambition that drive the finest athletes."
"Larry accidentally kills Wanda's husband and as a result their love is now unencumbered, except that a man has been falsely accused of the crime. Larry has 21 days to act before that man goes to the gallows, but will he?"
"For what would prove to be his final film, Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami gave himself a challenge: to create a dialogue between his work as a filmmaker and his work as a photographer, bridging the two art forms to which he had dedicated his life. Setting out to reconstruct the moments immediately before and after a photograph is taken, Kiarostami selected twenty-four still images—most of them stark landscapes inhabited only by foraging birds and other wildlife—and digitally animated each one into its own subtly evolving four-and-a-half-minute vignette, creating a series of poignant studies in movement, perception, and time. A sustained meditation on the process of image making, 24 FRAMES is a graceful and elegiac farewell from one of the giants of world cinema."
"Jean-Pierre Melville's first directorial effort was this 1946 short film about a clown and his partner, who find inspiration one day in the streets for their performance in the circus that night."
The perilous road to kicking the habit is explored in twenty-five vignettes involving outlandish suggestions and contraptions.
"A heart-racing spy story by Alfred Hitchcock, THE 39 STEPS follows Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) as he stumbles upon a conspiracy that thrusts him into a hectic chase across the Scottish moors—a chase in which he is both the pursuer and the pursued—as well as into an unexpected romance with the cool Pamela (Madeline Carroll). Adapted from a novel by John Buchan, this classic wrong-man thriller from the Master of Suspense anticipates the director’s most famous works (especially NORTH BY NORTHWEST), and remains one of his cleverest and most entertaining films."
"In this exquisitely calibrated film, Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay perform a subtly off-kilter pas de deux as Kate and Geoff, an English couple who, on the eve of an anniversary celebration, find their long marriage shaken by the arrival of a letter to Geoff that unceremoniously collapses his past into their shared present. Director Andrew Haigh carries the tradition of British realist cinema to artful new heights in 45 YEARS, weaving the momentous into the mundane as the pair go about their daily lives, while the evocatively flat, wintry Norfolk landscape frames their struggle to maintain an increasingly untenable status quo. Loosely adapting a short story by David Constantine, Haigh shifts the focus from the slightly erratic Geoff to Kate, eliciting a remarkable, nuanced portrayal by Rampling of a woman’s gradual metamorphosis from unflappable wife to woman undone."
Directed by Kenji Mizoguchi • 1941 • Japan
"At once a compelling piece of anti-isolationist propaganda and a quick-witted wartime thriller, 49TH PARALLEL is a classic early work from the inimitable British filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. When a Nazi U-boat crew, headed by the ruthless Eric Portman, is stranded in Canada during the thick of World War II, the men evade capture by hiding out in a series of rural communities, before trying to cross the border into the still-neutral United States. Both soul-stirring and delightfully entertaining, 49TH PARALLEL features a colorful cast of characters played by larger-than-life actors Laurence Olivier, Raymond Massey, Anton Walbrook, and Leslie Howard."
"François Truffaut’s first feature is also his most personal. Told through the eyes of Truffaut’s cinematic counterpart, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), THE 400 BLOWS sensitively re-creates the trials of Truffaut’s own childhood, unsentimentally portraying aloof parents, oppressive teachers, and petty crime. The film marked Truffaut’s passage from leading critic to trailblazing auteur of the French New Wave."
71 scenes detailing a college student who murders four people before committing suicide in his car on Christmas Eve.
"This 2015 short film by Kirsten Johnson was commissioned by Field of Vision, a filmmaker-driven visual journalism unit that pairs directors with developing stories around the globe. In THE ABOVE, a U.S. military surveillance balloon floats on a tether high about Kabul, Afghanistan. Its capacities are highly classified and deeply mysterious."
"The lives of miniscule mollusks are intimately captured as they wallow in mud, mate and give birth. Director Jean Painlevé sublimely sets their dance like movements to music."
John lives his life alone trying to connect with anything or anyone he can. Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between hysterical crying and hysterical laughter.
A close bond between two identical twins is tested when one sister rebels against their shared sense of oneness.
"A uniquely prolific and chameleonic figure of world cinema, Kon Ichikawa delivered a burst of stylistic bravado with this intricate tale of betrayal and retribution. Set in the cloistered world of nineteenth-century kabuki theater, the film charts a female impersonator’s attempts to avenge the deaths of his parents, who were driven to insanity and suicide by a trio of corrupt men. Ichikawa takes the conventions of melodrama and turns them on their head, bringing the hero’s fractured psyche to life in boldly experimental widescreen compositions infused with kaleidoscopic color, pop-art influences, and meticulous choreography. Anchored by a magnificently androgynous performance by Kazuo Hasegawa, reprising a role he had played on-screen three decades earlier, AN ACTOR’S REVENGE is an eye-popping examination of how the illusions of art intersect with life."
"The societal roles women are expected to play and the challenges of balancing career and family are the central subjects of Robert Greene’s rich, endlessly fascinating documentary. Combining elements of melodrama and cinema verité, the film follows the travails of a former actress turned housewife as she prepares to make a comeback. Brandy Burre had a recurring role on HBO’s THE WIRE when she gave up her career to start a family. She left New York City to make a home with her boyfriend and their two children in Beacon, New York. When Brandy decides to reclaim her life as an actor, the domestic world she’s thoughtfully created crumbles around her. Toying provocatively with questions of artifice and authenticity, ACTRESS is a multifaceted portrait of a complicated woman, performing the role of herself, in a complex story about starring in the movie of one’s own life."
"Noah Render (Elias Koteas) is an insurance claims adjuster who attends to his clients’ every need—including their sexual ones. His wife, Hera (Arsinée Khanjian), is a government censor who spends her days and nights obsessively watching pornography for both work and pleasure. When they become involved with Bubba (Maury Chaykin) and Mimi (Gabrielle Rose), a wealthy couple with a taste for kinky role-playing, the Renders’ lives are turned upside down in this surreal puzzle from Atom Egoyan."
"Atom Egoyan’s provocative twelfth feature continues his long-standing fascination with the relationship between technology and the construction of personal identity. Sabine (Arsinée Khanjian), a high school French teacher, gives her class a translation exercise based on a real news story about a terrorist who plants a bomb in the airline luggage of his pregnant girlfriend. The assignment has a profound effect on one student, Simon (Devon Bostick), who reimagines the news item as his own family’s story. When Simon uses the story as the basis to create a false online identity, it sets off a ripple effect of controversy and catharsis that reaches around the world."
This Russian dark comedy follows a supremely gifted dentist who is ridiculed and completely ostracized by his colleagues.
Cinéma vérité pioneer Robert Drew's fascinating documentary Adventures on the New Frontier offers a rare and candid glimpse inside the Oval Office as newly elected President John F. Kennedy goes about his daily work routine as America's Chief Executive.
"With this spare chamber piece, set in an empty theater, Ingmar Bergman returned to his perennial theme of the permeability of life and art. Lingering after a rehearsal for August Strindberg’s “A Dream Play” (a touchstone for the filmmaker throughout his career), eminent director Henrik (Erland Josephson) enters into a frank and flirtatious conversation with his up-and-coming star, Anna (Lena Olin), leading him to recall his affair with Anna’s late mother, the self-destructive actress Rakel (Ingrid Thulin). The sharply written and impeccably performed AFTER THE REHEARSAL, originally made for television, pares away all artifice to examine both the allure and the cost of a life in the theater."

"A freewheeling travelogue, a kaleidoscopic survey of the contemporary art scene, and a loving ode to creativity in all its forms, this five-part miniseries by the inimitable Agnès Varda takes us on a journey of discovery as she travels the globe—from Stockholm to St. Petersburg, Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City to Los Angeles—meeting with friends, artists, and fellow filmmakers. Along the way there are chats with titan auteurs Chris Marker (offering a window into his virtual-reality world) and a 102-year-old Manoel de Oliveira (doing his best Chaplin impersonation); visits to the Hermitage Museum, the Venice Biennale, and the home of Frida Kahlo; glimpses into the studios of acclaimed visual artists like Christian Boltanski, Annette Messager, and Pierre Soulages; and Varda’s casually profound musings on everything from rivers to the Dutch masters to her own photography and installation works. Never before released in the United States, this catalog of wonders great and small is a unique invitation to see the world through the eyes of one of cinema’s most playfully perceptive artists."

"ALAIN MIMOUN, a short film made about the titular long-distance runner, is a jewel of a documentary, enhanced by a wonderfully laid-back jazz score by Alain Goraguer."
"In ¡ALAMBRISTA!, a Mexican farmworker sneaks across the border to California to make money to send to his family back home. It is a story that happens every day, told here in an uncompromising, groundbreaking work of realism from American independent filmmaker Robert M. Young. Vivid and spare where other films about illegal immigration might sentimentalize, Young’s take is equal parts intimate character study and gripping road movie, a political work that never loses sight of the complex man at its center. ¡ALAMBRISTA!, winner of the Cannes Film Festival’s inaugural Caméra d'Or in 1978, remains one of the best films ever made on this perennially relevant topic."
"Eisenstein drew on history, Russian folk narratives, and the techniques of Walt Disney to create this broadly painted epic of Russian resilience. This story of Teutonic knights vanquished by Prince Alexander Nevsky’s tactical brilliance resonated deeply with a Soviet Union concerned with the rise of Nazi Germany. Widely imitated, most notably by Laurence Olivier’s Battle of Agincourt re-creation for HENRY V, the Battle on the Ice scene remains one of the most famous audio-visual experiments in film history, perfectly blending action with the rousing score of Sergei Prokofiev."
"Alice follows the White Rabbit into Wonderland, beginning a dream expedition into the astonishing landscape of childhood, through many dangerous adventures, and ultimately to a trial before the King and Queen of Hearts. Czech animation legend Jan Švankmajer blends live action and stunning stop motion to create a strikingly original interpretation of Lewis Carroll’s classic tale. Švankmajer’s ALICE remains true to the absurdity of Carroll’s vision, but bears the stamp of his own surrealist style and macabre obsessions, lending dark and fascinating new dimensions to a beloved fantasy."
"The first of the road films that would come to define the career of Wim Wenders, the magnificent ALICE IN THE CITIES is an emotionally generous and luminously shot odyssey. A German journalist (Rüdiger Vogler) is driving across the United States to research an article; it’s a disappointing trip, in which he is unable to truly connect with what he sees. Things change, however, when he has no choice but to take a young girl named Alice (Yella Rottländer) with him on his return trip to Germany, after her mother (Lisa Kreuzer)—whom he has just met—leaves the child in his care. Though they initially find themselves at odds, the pair begin to form an unlikely friendship."
"The wildly prolific German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder paid homage to his cinematic hero Douglas Sirk with this update of that filmmaker’s 1955 ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS. A lonely widow (Brigitte Mira) meets a much younger Arab worker (El Hedi ben Salem) in a bar during a rainstorm. They fall in love, to their own surprise—and to the outright shock of their families, colleagues, and drinking buddies. In ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL, Fassbinder expertly wields the emotional power of classic Hollywood melodrama to expose the racial tensions underlying contemporary German culture."
"Director Ishiro Honda returned again for the first Godzilla movie expressly for children. Economizing by reusing effects shots from other films in the series, All Monster Attack tells the story of Ichiro, a lonely latchkey kid who finds solace in his dreams of befriending Minilla, the titular progeny of Son of Godzilla, whose parent is also often absent. In this thoughtful, human-scale story, boy and monster learn together what it means to grow up."
"Vojtěch Jasný won the best director award at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival for this sweeping portrait of a small Czech village between the years of 1945 and 1958, during which the residents go from hopeful in the aftermath of the defeat of the Nazis to increasingly demoralized in the face of the Communist takeover. Lyrical in its feeling for landscape but biting in its social and political commentary, ALL MY GOOD COUNTRYMEN stands as the defining work by one of the lesser-known figures of the Czechoslovak New Wave."
"Othello is translated to the world of sixties London jazz clubs in Basil Dearden's smoky and sensational All Night Long. Over the course of one eventful evening, the anniversary celebration of the musical and romantic partners Aurelius Rex (Paul Harris) and Delia Lane (Marti Stevens), a jealous, ambitious drummer, Johnny Cousin (Patrick McGoohan), attempts to tear the interracial couple apart. This daring psychodrama also features on-screen appearances by jazz legends Charles Mingus, Dave Brubeck, Tubby Hayes, and Johnny Dankworth."
A man makes dates with two women on the same day without realizing that they are best friends. Directed by Jean-Luc Godard.
"In a wash of dreamily impressionistic images, this award-winning end-of-innocence tale evokes the world of a young man coming to terms with his father’s deteriorating sanity."
"When the famous cellist Jarl Kulle bribes a critic to write his biography, the critic decides to blackmail him with the intimate details gleaned from the many women in his life."
"Somewhere in Southeast Asia, in a remote village on a wide and turbulent river, a European man (Stanislas Merhar) clings to his pipe dreams of discovering a fortune out of love for his mixed-race daughter (Aurora Marion). Adapted from the novel by Joseph Conrad, the sensuously atmospheric final narrative film by Chantal Akerman transposes the story from the late 1800s to the 1950s to create a trenchant critique of colonialism in its dying days wrapped in a saga of passion, loss, and madness."
This experimental short film presents a sick woman's nightmare involving living representations of the alphabet.
"Yorgos Lanthimos’s surreally funny follow-up to his international breakthrough DOGTOOTH is a mysterious and moving investigation into the process of mourning. An oddball group of four people (two hospital employees, a gymnast, and her coach) form a secret society that sets out to ease the grieving process for those whose loved ones have died. For a fee they will act the part of the missing family member, learning their hobbies and eccentricities in order to help the customer accept their loss. As methadone is to heroin addiction, so are the Alps, as they call themselves, to the mourning process. But when the nurse known as Monte Rosa (Angeliki Papoulia) begins to attach too deeply to her subjects, their project spirals out of control into violence and chaos."
"his 1978 documentary is Les Blank’s celebration of the spirit and social traditions of New Orleans, featuring Mardi Gras and St. Patrick’s Day celebrations as well as musical performances by Allen Toussaint, Kid Thomas Valentine, Professor Longhair, and others."
"This carnivalesque portrait of provincial Italy during the fascist period, the most personal film from Federico Fellini, satirizes the director’s youth and turns daily life into a circus of social rituals, adolescent desires, male fantasies, and political subterfuge, all set to Nina Rota’s classic, nostalgia-tinged score. The Academy Award winning AMARCORD remains one of cinema’s enduring treasures."
"This 1998 short film by Miranda July, in which a “professional” monitors an “amateur” (both played by July) via video surveillance, is a portrait of a woman on the brink of technology-induced madness."
"Martin Scorsese spends an evening with larger-than-life raconteur Steven Prince—a former drug addict, road manager for Neil Diamond, and actor who memorably played the gun salesman in TAXI DRIVER—as he recounts stories from his colorful life (one of which later inspired a key scene in PULP FICTION)."
"Wim Wenders pays loving homage to rough-and-tumble Hollywood film noir with THE AMERICAN FRIEND, a loose adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel “Ripley’s Game.” Dennis Hopper oozes quirky menace as an amoral American art dealer who entangles a terminally ill German everyman, played by Bruno Ganz, in a seedy criminal underworld as revenge for a personal slight, but when the two become embroiled in an ever-deepening murder plot, they form an unlikely bond. Filmed on location in Hamburg and Paris, with some scenes shot in grimy, late-seventies New York City, Wenders’ international breakout is a stripped-down crime story that mixes West German and American film flavors, and it features cameos by filmmakers Jean Eustache, Samuel Fuller, and Nicholas Ray."
"The German-born American GI Ricky (Karl Scheydt) returns to Munich from Vietnam and is promptly hired as a contract killer. Rainer Werner Fassbinder's experimental noir is a subversive, self-reflexive gangster movie full of unexpected asides and stylistic flourishes, and features an audaciously bonkers final shot and memorable turns from many of the director's rotating gallery of players."
"This major early achievement by Michelangelo Antonioni bears the first signs of the cinema-changing style for which he would soon be world-famous. LE AMICHE (THE GIRLFRIENDS) is a brilliantly observed, fragmentary depiction of modern bourgeois life, conveyed from the perspective of five Turinese women. As four of the friends try to make sense of the suicide attempt of the fifth, they find themselves examining their own troubled romantic lives. With suggestions of the theme of modern alienation and the fastidious visual abstraction that would define his later masterpieces such as L’AVVENTURA, L’ECLISSE, and RED DESERT, Antonioni’s film is a devastating take on doomed love and fraught friendship."
"Roberto Rosselini directs Anna Magnani in two short films about love and loneliness. In the first, a woman makes a last-ditch attempt to save her relationship over the phone. In the second, a peasant woman believes she is pregnant with the son of God."
"This contemplative short film, directed by Maurice Pialat in 1960, depicts life in the banlieues, or suburbs, of Paris and the dead-end existence of the youth residing there."
A double amputee attempts to write a letter while her nurse gets in the way.
A double amputee attempts to write a letter while her nurse gets in the way.
"The Quays’ interest in esoteric illusions finds its perfect realization in this fascinating animated lecture on the antique art of anamorphosis, a technique that uses visual distortion to hide mischievous symbols within paintings."
"After the death in 2004 of American theater actor and monologist Spalding Gray, director Steven Soderbergh pieced together a narrative of Gray’s life to create the documentary AND EVERYTHING IS GOING FINE. Brilliantly and sensitively assembled entirely from footage of Gray, taken from interviews and one-man shows from throughout his career, it is a rich, full portrait—an autobiography of sorts—of a figure who was never less than candid but retained an air of mystery."
"The astounding success of Roger Vadim’s AND GOD CREATED WOMAN revolutionized the foreign film market and turned Brigitte Bardot into an international star. Bardot stars as Juliette, an 18-year-old orphan whose unbridled appetite for pleasure shakes up all of St. Tropez; her sweet but naïve husband Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant) endures beatings, insults, and mambo in his attempts to tame her wild ways."
"In the aftermath of the 1990 earthquake in Iran that left fifty thousand dead, Abbas Kiarostami returned to Koker, where his camera surveys not only devastation but also the teeming life in its wake. Blending fiction and reality into a playful, poignant road movie, AND LIFE GOES ON follows a film director who, along with his son, makes the trek to the region in hopes of finding out if the young boys who acted in WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE? are among the survivors, and discovers a resilient community pressing on in the face of tragedy. Finding beauty in the bleakest of circumstances, Kiarostami crafts a quietly majestic ode to the best of the human spirit."
"Tracing the life of a renowned icon painter, the second feature by Andrei Tarkovsky vividly conjures the murky world of medieval Russia. This dreamlike and remarkably tactile film follows Andrei Rublev as he passes through a series of poetically linked scenes—snow falls inside an unfinished church, naked pagans stream through a thicket during a torchlit ritual, a boy oversees the clearing away of muddy earth for the forging of a gigantic bell—gradually emerging as a man struggling mightily to preserve his creative and religious integrity. Appearing here in the director’s preferred 183-minute cut as well as the version that was originally suppressed by Soviet authorities, the masterwork ANDREI RUBLEV is one of Tarkovsky’s most revered films, an arresting meditation on art, faith, and endurance."
"George Bernard Shaw's breezy, delightful dramatization of this classic fable, about a Christian slave who pulls a thorn from a lion's paw and is spared from death in the Colosseum as a result of his kind act, was written as a meditation on modern Christian values. And Pascal's final Shaw production plays it broadly, casting comic character actor Alan Young as the titular naïf. He's ably supported by Jean Simmons, Victor Mature, Robert Newton, and Elsa Lanchester."
"In 1986, Louis Malle, himself a transplant to the United States, set out to investigate the ever-widening range of immigrant experience in America. Interviewing a variety of newcomers (from teachers to astronauts to doctors) in middle- and working-class communities from coast to coast, Malle paints a generous, humane portrait of their individual struggles in an increasingly polyglot nation."
"In Fellini’s quirky, imaginative fable, a motley crew of European aristocrats (and a lovesick rhinoceros!) board a luxurious ocean liner on the eve of World War I to scatter the ashes of a beloved diva. Fabricated entirely in Rome’s famed Cinecittà studios, AND THE SHIP SAILS ON (E LA NAVE VA) reaches spectacular new visual heights with its stylized re-creation of a decadent bygone era."
"Emeteria (85) is visited by the ghost of her patrón, Teodoro. She believes he has come to take her to the afterlife, but he has more devastating news."
"Legendary Beat visionary Bob Kaufman considered poetry a key to human survival, an idea made all the more legitimate by the longevity it is granted: the things he saw, heard, tasted, felt, and, most of all, thought were preserved in his work. Embodying the spirit of those efforts, director Billy Woodberry’s first feature since his 1983 LA Rebellion landmark BLESS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS is perhaps the closest we can come to knowing the man and his time. Both dense and nimble in its assemblage of archival footage and photos, interviews with contemporaries, and readings from the likes of Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, AND WHEN I DIE looks back at a familiar era with new eyes, thanks in no small part to the honest assessment provided by many figures of New York’s Beat generation some half-century removed."
This short was made by SMITHEREENS director Susan Seidelman when she was a film student at New York University in 1976.
"With AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE, Academy Award–winning filmmaker Jane Campion brought to the screen the harrowing autobiography of Janet Frame, New Zealand’s most distinguished author. Three actors in turn take on the lead role (including Kerry Fox in a marvelous performance as the adult Frame), as the film describes a journey from an impoverished childhood marked by tragedy to a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia resulting in electroshock therapy and a narrowly escaped lobotomy to, finally, international literary fame. Unobtrusively capturing the beauty and power of the New Zealand landscape while maintaining the film’s focus on the figure at its center, Campion broke new ground for female filmmakers everywhere and earned a sweep of her country’s film awards, along with the Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival."
"Ján Kadár, codirector of the Oscar-winning Czechoslovak New Wave touchstone THE SHOP ON MAIN STREET, made his Hollywood debut with this unique, long-overlooked adaptation of a Bernard Malamud story, coscripted by visionary independent filmmaker Bill Gunn and produced by star Harry Belafonte. The legendary Zero Mostel stars as Morris Mishkin, a poor New York City tailor struggling to support his ailing wife (Ida Kaminska), whose difficulties have caused him to turn against his Jewish faith. Enter Alexander Levine (Belafonte), a Black Jewish angel who makes it his mission to restore hope to Mishkin’s life. Gloria Foster, who would go on to achieve widespread fame as the Oracle in THE MATRIX, costars."
"Director Shahbaz Noshir’s 2002 film about an encounter with prejudice is titled ANGST ISST SEELE AUF (FEAR EATS THE SOUL), a grammatically correct version of Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1974 film ANGST ESSEN SEELE AUF (FEAR EAT SOUL). It has the same lead actress (Brigitte Mira), director of photography (Jürgen Jürges), and editor (Thea Eymèsz)."
"He loves me, he loves me not... Anna Karenina risks her marriage, social standing, and a relationship with her son all for the illicit love of a young cavalry officer. As expected, things get complicated."
"Raymond Bernard's Anne-Marie was a special movie on several counts -- as a feature film from the 1930's about a young woman who aspires to become a pilot, and as the next-to-last pre-war French film by the star Annabella before she left went to Hollywood. But its special status resides in its screenplay, the sole work in that writing genre by renowned aviator/author Antoine de Saint-Exupery (1900-1944), whose credits also included The Little Prince."
"Inspired by the true story of a spy scandal that rocked Britain, this handsome adaptation by Julian Mitchell of his own successful stage play stars Rupert Everett as Guy Bennett, a young gay man at a 1930s boarding school. Ostracized by his fellow classmates for his foppish manners, Bennett is drawn to fellow outcast Tommy Judd (Colin Firth), an outspoken Marxist who makes no attempt to hide his disdain for the British class system. Bound together as outsiders, their friendship will drastically shape the course of each of their lives."
"Lars von Trier shook up the film world when he premiered ANTICHRIST at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. In this graphic psychodrama, a grief-stricken man and woman—a searing Willem Dafoe and Cannes best actress winner Charlotte Gainsbourg—retreat to their cabin deep in the woods after the accidental death of their infant son, only to find terror and violence at the hands of nature and, ultimately, each other. But this most confrontational work yet from one of contemporary cinema’s most controversial artists is no mere provocation. It is a visually sublime, emotionally ravaging journey to the darkest corners of the possessed human mind; a disturbing battle of the sexes that pits rational psychology against age-old superstition; and a profoundly effective horror film."
"This short film is the first segment of five in the multinational feature Love at Twenty (1962), all five segments on the theme of first adult love. After indulging in much delinquency in his youth, seventeen-year-old Antoine Doinel, having been provided opportunity to get out of that delinquent life, is now an upstanding member of society working for Philips Records, which allows him to indulge in his love of music. At the Youth Concerts, he has noticed the same young woman at several performances. She is Colette and the two begin to date. Colette treats Antoine like a buddy, while Antoine has fallen in love with her. His pursuit of getting Colette to be his exclusive girlfriend is helped on the surface by the fact that Colette's parents like him and encourage their dating. He uses grand romantic gestures to try and prove his love. Will Colette ultimately fall for Antoine's romanticism?"
"Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) designed some of the world’s most astonishing buildings, interiors, and parks; Japanese director Hiroshi Teshigahara constructed some of the most aesthetically audacious films ever made. In ANTONIO GAUDÍ, their artistry melds in a unique, enthralling cinematic experience. Less a documentary than a visual poem, Teshigahara’s film takes viewers on a tour of Gaudí’s truly spectacular architecture, including his massive, still-unfinished master­piece, the Sagrada Família basilica in Barcelona. With camera work as bold and sensual as the curves of his subject’s organic structures, Teshigahara immortalizes Gaudí on film."
Khalik Allah’s unflinching follow-up to his short URBAN RASHOMON breaks down the barriers between photography and cinema to create a free-associative portrait of a mentally ill homeless man named Frenchie.
"A precursor to Bette Gordon’s feature debut VARIETY, this lo-fi No Wave provocation shot on Super 8 features Wooster Group members Spalding Gray and Nancy Reilly discussing their erotic fantasies and thoughts on pornography."
"This ice-cool crime caper bridges two generations of French cinema by bringing together longtime national screen icon Jean Gabin with hotshot rising star Alain Delon. Gabin is the career ex-con determined to pull off one last heist before he retires. Delon is the petty thief he enlists to help him rob a Cannes casino. They’ve got a seemingly perfect plan, until . . . Veteran director Henri Verneuil lends his craftsman’s touch to this jazz-inflected noir that rivals the thrillers of Jean-Pierre Melville for expertly deployed tension."
"Satyajit Ray had not planned to make a sequel to PATHER PANCHALI, but after the film’s international success, he decided to continue Apu’s narrative. APARAJITO picks up where the first film leaves off, with Apu and his family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy city of Varanasi (then known as Benares). As Apu progresses from wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager, eventually studying in Kolkata, we witness his academic and moral education, as well as the growing complexity of his relationship with his mother. This tenderly expressive, often heart-wrenching film, which won three top prizes at the Venice Film Festival, including the Golden Lion, not only extends but also spiritually deepens the tale of Apu."
"For Apart from You, Mikio Naruse turned his camera on the lives of working women, which he would continue to do throughout his long career. In this gently devastating drama, a critical breakthrough for the director, he contrasts the life of an aging geisha, whose angry teenage son is ashamed of her profession, with that of her youthful counterpart, a lovely young girl resentful of her family for forcing her into a life of ignominy."
"Amidst rumors of his lower class origins that threaten his job, a school teacher pleads for freedom and equality. Keisuke Kinoshita directs."
"A newlywed couple, a revivalist preacher, and other pioneers celebrate the construction of a farm house in this filmed ballet conceived and choregraphed by Martha Graham."
"By the time APUR SANSAR was released, Satyajit Ray had directed not only the first two Apu films but also the masterpiece THE MUSIC ROOM, and was well on his way to becoming a legend. This extraordinary final chapter brings our protagonist’s journey full circle. Apu is now in his early twenties, out of college, and hoping to live as a writer. Alongside his professional ambitions, the film charts his romantic awakening, which occurs as the result of a most unlikely turn of events, and his eventual, fraught fatherhood. Featuring soon to be Ray regulars Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in star-making performances, and demonstrating Ray’s ever more impressive skills as a crafter of pure cinematic imagery, APUR SANSAR is a moving conclusion to this monumental trilogy."
"In his ruthlessly clear-eyed final film, French master Robert Bresson pushed his unique blend of spiritual rumination and formal rigor to a new level of astringency. Transposing a Tolstoy novella to contemporary Paris, L’ARGENT follows a counterfeit bill as it originates as a prop in a schoolboy prank, then circulates like a virus among the corrupt and the virtuous alike before landing with a young truck driver and leading him to incarceration and violence. With brutal economy, Bresson constructs his unforgiving vision of original sin out of starkly perceived details, rooting his characters in a dehumanizing material world that withholds any hope of transcendence."
"In this short film, directed by Agnieszka Smoczyńska in 2007 while she was a student at the Wajda School in Warsaw, a housewife falls under the spell of her new upstairs neighbor, an opera diva."
"In Kaurismäki's drolly existential crime drama, a coal miner named Taisto (Turo Pajala) attempts to leave behind a provincial life of inertia and economic despair, only to get into ever deeper trouble. Yet a minor-key romance with a hilariously dispassionate meter maid (Susanna Haavisto) might provide a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. Ariel, which boasts a terrific soundtrack of Finnish tango and Baltic pop music and lovely cinematography by Kaurismäki's longtime cameraman Timo Salmimen, put its director on the international map."
"Serbian visionary Emir Kusturica (UNDERGROUND) gate-crashed Hollywood with this singular, marvelously loopy surrealist comedy featuring a remarkable cast that includes Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway, Jerry Lewis, Lili Taylor, and Vincent Gallo. When his uncle (Lewis) in Arizona invites him to come work at the family car dealership, Axel Blackmar (Depp), a young man from New York obsessed with Eskimos and fish (and, specifically, their dreams), heads West, where he encounters lusty romance with a wealthy widow (Dunaway) and a series of oddball exploits involving turtles, a DIY flying machine, and a strikingly convincing recreation of an iconic set piece from NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Like its title implies, ARIZONA DREAM takes place on its own hallucinatory wavelength, a delirious, anything-goes vision of America as seen through the eyes of one of cinema’s great magic makers."
"Kinoshita's ambitious and intensely moving film begins as a multigenerational epic about the military legacy of one Japanese family, before settling into an emotionally complex portrayal of parental love during wartime. As the mother and father of a boy shipped off to battle, Kinuyo Tanaka and Chishu Ryu locate profound depths of feeling that transcend ideology."
"Captain Hugh 'Bulldog' Drummond, a former British officer in World War I, grows bored with civilian life and decides to become a private investigator. Part James Bond, part Sherlock Holmes, Bulldog Drummond is never short on excitement."
"The following 1959 short by Jacques Demy tells the story of Jean-Marie Baptiste Vianney, the strict and pious pastor of the village of Ars."
"After a casting session, two filmmakers found the perfect 14-year-old girl to star in their new movie. Now, they have to convince the reluctant mother to let her daughter play the role of a sexually abused child. What follows is a witty argumentation on proper parenting and on the abuses and sacrifices made in the name of great works of art."
"Mark Landis has been called one of the most prolific art forgers in U.S. history. His impressive body of work spans thirty years and a wide range of styles, from fifteenth-century masters to Picasso to Walt Disney. And while the copies could fetch impressive sums on the open market, Landis isn’t in it for the money. Posing as a philanthropic donor, a grieving executor of a family member’s will, and even a Jesuit priest, Landis has given away hundreds of works over the years to a staggering array of institutions. But when a tenacious investigator threatens to expose his ruse, Landis must confront his controversial legacy and a growing chorus of art-world professionals calling for him to stop. What begins as a gripping cat-and-mouse art caper, rooted in questions of authorship and authenticity, gradually develops into an intimate story of obsession and the universal need for community, appreciation, and purpose."
"One of the most popular jazz bands of the 1930s teaches you the ABCs of swing with performances of Artie Shaw’s theme song, “Nightmare,” and “I Have Eyes,” sung by Helen Forrest."
A young boy wants to have his first kiss but has no luck in the small village he lives in. His best friends tell him about girls in the city that get high and easy to make out with when they smoke cigarettes. He questions their story but still decides to join them to the city and find out for himself.
"Shepitko's emotionally overwhelming final film won the Golden Bear at the 1977 Berlin Film Festival and has been hailed around the world as the finest Soviet film of its decade. Set during World War II's darkest days, THE ASCENT follows the path of two peasant soldiers, cut off from their troop, who trudge through the snowy backwoods of Belarus seeking refuge among villagers. Their harrowing trek leads them on a journey of betrayal, heroism, and ultimate transcendence."
"On the last day of World War II in a small town somewhere in Poland, Polish exiles of war and the occupying Soviet forces confront the beginning of a new day and a new Poland. In this incendiary environment we find Home Army soldier Maciek Chelmicki, who has been ordered to assassinate an incoming commissar. But a mistake stalls his progress and leads him to Krystyna, a beautiful barmaid who gives him a glimpse of what his life could be. Gorgeously photographed and brilliantly performed, ASHES AND DIAMONDS masterfully interweaves the fate of a nation with that of one man, resulting in one of the most important Polish films of all time."
Harold Lloyd plays a young man who attempts to avoid many obstacles in order to marry his boss's daughter.
"In this endlessly diverting compendium of four short films, Pierre Etaix regards the 1960s from his askew but astute perspective. Each part is as technically impressive as it is riotous: a man attempts to read a novel about vampires beside his sleeping wife but cannot seem to separate reality from fiction; a simple afternoon at the movies becomes a consumer-culture assault; a jarringly noisy urban landscape keeps a city’s population on edge; and a day in the country means something different to a picnicking city couple, a hunter, and a farmer."
"Suzan Pitt's animated short throws open the doors of perception onto a shape-shifting vision of polymorphous sexuality. A landmark in the history of independent animation, ASPARAGUS is a mesmerizing exploration of the artist's inner world, and a viewing experience like no other."
"Masahiro Shinoda's Assassin (aka Ansatsu) was the director's first period film - but it is hardly set in the ""safety"" of a past era, as its story, of a masterless samurai (Tetsuro Tamba) making his way amid the chaotic aftermath of Commodore Perry's forcible contact with Japan in 1853, seems to resonate clearly in Japan's post-World War II era. Shinoda presents a stark picture of social and political upheaval, spreading duplicity and dishonor, and the consequences of up-ending the established order in a society built on expectations of a rigid social order."
"Inspector ""Wens"" Vorobechik and his aspiring actress girlfriend search for a serial killer who leaves mysterious calling cards."
"To pass on knowledge acquired during a lifetime of experience is a clear way to leave your legacy. A professional killer, Wagner, learns that he is dying and seeks an apprentice to bestow his lethal wisdom upon. In finding an ideal candidate in Max, a petty thief, Wagner ensures the deadly trade of an assassin will continue."
"In Jean Vigo’s hands, an unassuming tale of conjugal love becomes an achingly romantic reverie of desire and hope. Jean (Jean Dasté), a barge captain, marries Juliette (Dita Parlo), an innocent country girl, and the two climb aboard Jean’s boat, the L’ATALANTE—otherwise populated by an earthy first mate (Michel Simon) and a multitude of mangy cats—and embark on their new life together. Both a surprisingly erotic idyll and a clear-eyed meditation on love, L’ATALANTE, Vigo’s only feature-length work, is a film like no other."
"A mere twelve years after Los Angeles in 1984, the Olympic Games returned to the United States for the Games of the XXVI Olympiad. Bud Greenspan's Cappy Productions was commissioned to make the film, titled ATLANTA'S OLYMPIC GLORY, the fourth of the ten Olympic documentaries that Greenspan would make before his passing in 2010."
"Directed by Mati Diop • 2009 • France, Senegal
"
"When a nuclear-powered submarine, the Tiger Shark, sets out to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances near the Arctic Circle, its fearless crew finds itself besieged by electrical storms, an Unidentified Floating Saucer, and lots of hairy tentacles."
"Part of the new wave of Greek cinema, ATTENBERG is an offbeat coming-of-age film.  Twenty-three-year-old Marina is living in a small factory town by the sea where her once-visionary architect father has returned to die.  Finding the human species foreign, she keeps her distance, choosing to observe mankind through Sir David Attenborough’s mammal documentaries and the songs of Suicide.  While preparing for her father’s impending death, Marina discovers her own sexuality through lessons from her only friend, Bella, and a visiting engineer. Equal parts abstract theater and melodrama, ATTENBERG is a sincere and humorous look at life’s defining moments."
"An incredible document of the LGBT film scene in the early 1980s (as well as artist Barbara Hammer’s off-the-charts charisma), AUDIENCE finds Hammer working in a more straightforward documentary mode than usual. Hammer interviews her largely lesbian audiences before and after screenings of her work, capturing their reactions to her radical, erotic, experimental films."
"A profound masterpiece from one of the most revered filmmakers in the history of cinema, Robert Bresson’s AU HASARD BALTHAZAR follows the donkey Balthazar as he is passed from owner to owner, some kind and some cruel but all with motivations beyond his understanding. Balthazar, whose life parallels that of his first keeper, Marie, is truly a beast of burden, suffering the sins of humankind. But despite his powerlessness, he accepts his fate nobly. Through Bresson’s unconventional approach to composition, sound, and narrative, this simple story becomes a moving parable about purity and transcendence."
"AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS tells a heartbreaking story of friendship and devastating loss concerning two boys living in Nazi-occupied France. At a provincial Catholic boarding school, the precocious youths enjoy true camaraderie—until a secret is revealed. Based on events from writer-director Malle’s own childhood, the film is a subtle, precisely observed tale of courage, cowardice, and tragic awakening."
"The last film by Yasujiro Ozu was also his final masterpiece, a gently heartbreaking story about a man’s dignifed resignation to life’s shifting currents and society’s modernization. Though the widower Shuhei (frequent Ozu leading man Chishu Ryu) has been living comfortably for years with his grown daughter, a series of events leads him to accept and encourage her marriage and departure from their home. As elegantly composed and achingly tender as any of the Japanese master’s films, AN AUTUMN AFTERNOON is one of cinema’s fondest farewells."
"AUTUMN SONATA was the only collaboration between cinema’s two great Bergmans: Ingmar and Ingrid, the monumental star of CASABLANCA. The grande dame, playing an icy concert pianist, is matched beat for beat in ferocity by the filmmaker’s recurring lead Liv Ullmann, as her eldest daughter. Over the course of a day and a long, painful night that the two spend together after an extended separation, they finally confront the bitter discord of their relationship. This cathartic pas de deux, evocatively shot in burnished harvest colors, ranks among the director’s major dramatic works."
"Michelangelo Antonioni invented a new film grammar with this masterwork. An iconic piece of challenging 1960s cinema and a gripping narrative on its own terms, L’AVVENTURA concerns the enigmatic disappearance of a young woman during a yachting trip off the coast of Sicily, and the search taken up by her disaffected lover (Gabriele Ferzetti) and best friend (Monica Vitti, in her breakout role). Antonioni’s controversial international sensation is a gorgeously shot tale of modern ennui and spiritual isolation."
"Volker Schlöndorff transported Bertolt Brecht's 1918 debut play to contemporary West Germany for this vicious experiment in adaptation, seldom seen for nearly half a century. Oozing with brutish charisma, Rainer Werner Fassbinder embodies the eponymous anarchist poet, who feels that bourgeois society has rejected him and sets off on a schnapps-soaked rampage. Hewing faithfully to Brecht's text, Schlöndorff juxtaposes the theatricality of the prose with bare-bones, handheld 16 mm camera work, which gives immediacy to this savage story of rebellion. Featuring a supporting cast drawn from Fassbinder's troupe of theater actors that also includes Margarethe von Trotta, BAAL demonstrates the uncompromising vision of its director, a trailblazer of the New German Cinema."
"At once a rousing paean to artistic creation, a delicate evocation of divine grace, and the ultimate film about food, the Oscar-winning BABETTE’S FEAST is a deeply beloved treasure of cinema. Directed by Gabriel Axel and adapted from a story by Isak Dinesen, it is the lovingly layered tale of a French housekeeper with a mysterious past who brings quiet revolution in the form of one exquisite meal to a circle of starkly pious villagers in late nineteenth-century Denmark. BABETTE’S FEAST combines earthiness and reverence in an indescribably moving depiction of sensual pleasure that goes to your head like fine champagne."
"Taylor Mead plays the president of the United Status, who, when he isn't at the White House, a dilapidated Victorian, conducts his top-secret affairs on a deserted beach. Robert Downey Sr.’s first feature is a rollicking, slapstick, ultra-low-budget 16 mm comedy experiment that introduced a twisted new voice to the New York underground."
"D. A. Pennebaker credits this 1954 film with clarifying his focus. He took his daughter, Stacy, to the zoo with a short film scenario in mind: shots of Stacy running intercut with shots of the animals responding to her. But Stacy was more interested in the carousel, and when her father observed her joy as she rode it, he knew he had found his film."
"A long-lost reggae classic reemerges. Suppressed following its Cannes premiere for fear that it would stoke racial tension, Franco Rosso’s incendiary portrait of sound-system culture in 1980s South London follows a young dancehall DJ (Brinsley Forde, frontman of landmark British reggae group Aswad) as he pursues his musical ambitions, battling fiercely against the racism and xenophobia of employers, neighbors, police, and the National Front. Featuring beautifully smoky cinematography and a blistering soundtrack, BABYLON is a raw, fearless howl of defiance tempered by the hazy bliss of the dancehall."
"A few years from now . . . As Bacurau, a small town in the Brazilian sertão, mourns the loss of its ninety-four-year-old matriarch, its inhabitants (among them national cinema icon Sônia Braga) begin to notice a series of strange happenings: their village has literally vanished from online maps, cell phones have stopped working, and a UFO-like drone hovers menacingly overhead. An ominous force is converging on Bacurau, an unknown threat that will force the community to band together and fight for its survival. Luckily, the resourceful residents are more than up for the challenge. A blistering sci-fi thriller streaked with antiracist and anticolonialist rage, the new film from AQUARIUS director Kleber Mendonça Filho, codirected with Juliano Dornelles, is an audacious, furiously entertaining model of genre art as a vehicle for political resistance."
"Isabel and Matt are a couple. Isabel and Joanna are roommates. As Joanna inserts herself into every aspect of Isabel’s relationship, the boundaries begin to blur in this unsparingly frank and funny look at the limits of love and friendship."
"It’s a holiday to remember—or not—when a young man joins his dotty elderly aunt for a Christmas party at her local Conservative Club, where the wine is flowing, the bingo is heated, and the cracks in the genteel facade start to show."
"A young executive hunts down his father’s killer in director Akira Kurosawa’s scathing THE BAD SLEEP WELL. Continuing his legendary collaboration with actor Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa combines elements of “Hamlet” and American film noir to chilling effect in exposing the corrupt boardrooms of postwar corporate Japan."
"Amid the decaying elegance of cold-war Vienna, psychoanalyst Dr. Alex Linden (Art Garfunkel) becomes mired in an erotically charged affair with the elusive Milena Flaherty (Theresa Russell). When their all-consuming passion takes a life-threatening turn, Inspector Netusil (Harvey Keitel) is assigned to piece together the sordid details. Acclaimed for its innovative editing, raw performances, and stirring musical score—featuring Tom Waits, the Who, and Billie Holiday—Nicolas Roeg’s BAD TIMING is a masterful, deeply disturbing foray into the dark world of sexual obsession."
"Delicate and jazzy, THE BAKERY GIRL OF MONCEAU, the first entry in the Six Moral Tales series, evinces stirrings of what would become the Eric Rohmer style: unfussy naturalistic shooting, ironic first-person voice-over, and an “unknowable” woman. A law student (played by producer and future director Barbet Schroeder) with a roving eye and a large appetite stuffs himself with sugary pastries daily in order to gain the affection of a pretty brunette who works in a quaint Paris bakery. But is he truly interested, or is she just a sweet diversion?"
"La Balance was a legitimate French attempt to reclaim the international crime film genre that the Americans had defined and dominated since the 1930s. With Hollywood-level (and style) violence and American-born (though French-based) filmmaker Bob Swaim in the director's chair, and a first-rate cast in a good, straight-forward crime story, it pushed all the right buttons with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-1980s--especially the incredibly suspenseful final quarter-hour."
"Russian soldier Alyosha Skvortsov is granted a visit with his mother after he single-handedly fends off two enemy tanks. As he journeys home, Alyosha encounters the devastation of his war-torn country, witnesses glimmers of hope among the people, and falls in love. With its poetic visual imagery, Grigori Chukhrai’s BALLAD OF A SOLDIER is an unconventional meditation on the effects of war, and a milestone in Russian cinema."
A solder and his wife work modest jobs in order to support themselves and their son.
"This haunting, kabuki-inflected version of a Japanese folk legend is set in a remote mountain village where food is scarce and tradition dictates that citizens who have reached their seventieth year must be carried to the summit of Mount Narayama and left there to die. The sacrificial elder at the center of the tale is Orin (Kinuyo Tanaka), a dignified and dutiful woman who spends her dwindling days securing the happiness of her loyal widowed son with a respectable new wife. Filmed almost entirely on cunningly designed studio sets, in brilliant color and widescreen, THE BALLAD OF NARAYAMA is a stylish and vividly formal work from Japan’s cinematic golden age, directed by the dynamic Keisuke Kinoshita."
"A blind travelling musician is abused and oppressed wherever she goes, even as the modern world imposes change around her. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda."
Tatsuya Nakadai stars as a vengeful ex-samurai commanding a gang of outlaws in an attack on the castle of his former master.
"This outrageous blend of science fiction, high camp, and erotic fantasia made Jane Fonda a permanent cult icon. She is sensational as a wide-eyed space adventurer whose quest to track down a famed scientist takes her to the Tau Ceti galaxy, where she encounters an array of perilously kinky pleasures. Described by director Roger Vadim as “a kind of sexual ‘Alice in Wonderland’ of the future,” BARBARELLA has taken its place as a midnight-movie classic thanks to its trippy art direction and sense of kitschy comic-book fun."
"In one of his own favorite roles, Vincent Price portrays legendary swindler James Addison Reavis, who in 1880 concocted an elaborate and dangerous hoax to name himself the ""Baron"" of Arizona, and therefore inherit all the land in the state. Samuel Fuller adapts this tall tale to film with fleet, elegant storytelling and a sly sense of humor."
A divorced single mother enters a world of confusion after her friend leaves her a cryptic message shortly before being murdered.
"Six characters meet in a bath house. The pedant bath house manager, a couple with a strange way of communicating and a gang with shady intentions. Something goes wrong."
"One of the most influential political films in history, THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, by Gillo Pontecorvo, vividly re-creates a key year in the tumultuous Algerian struggle for independence from the occupying French in the 1950s. As violence escalates on both sides, children shoot soldiers at point-blank range, women plant bombs in cafés, and French soldiers resort to torture to break the will of the insurgents. Shot on the streets of Algiers in documentary style, the film is a case study in modern warfare, with its terrorist attacks and the brutal techniques used to combat them. Pontecorvo’s tour de force has astonishing relevance today."
This incredibly influential Soviet silent film depicts a crew mutiny on the Russian Battleship Potemkin.
"This precisely wrought, emotionally penetrating romantic drama from Jacques Demy, set largely in the casinos of Nice, is a visually lovely but darkly realistic investigation into love and obsession. A bottle-blonde Jeanne Moreau is at her blithe best as a gorgeous gambling addict, and Claude Mann is the bank clerk drawn into her risky world. Featuring a mesmerizing score by Michel Legrand, BAY OF ANGELS is among Demy’s most somber works."
"“If we opened people up, we’d find landscapes. If we opened me up, we’d find beaches.” Originally intended to be Agnès Varda’s farewell to filmmaking, this enchanting auto-portrait, made in her eightieth year, is a freewheeling journey through her life, career, and artistic philosophy. Revisiting the places that shaped her—from the North Sea beaches of Belgium where she spent her childhood to the Mediterranean village where she shot her first film to the boardwalks of Los Angeles where she lived with her husband, Jacques Demy—Varda reflects on a lifetime of creation and inspiration, successes and setbacks, heartbreak and joy. Replete with images of wonder and whimsy—the ocean reflected in a kaleidoscope of mirrors, the streets of Paris transformed into a sandy beach, the filmmaker herself ensconced in the belly of a whale—The Beaches of Agnès is a playful and poignant record of a life lived fully and passionately in the name of cinema."
"The 1976 cinema vérité classic GREY GARDENS, which captured in remarkable close-up the lives of the eccentric East Hampton recluses Big and Little Edie Beale, has spawned everything from a midnight-movie cult following to a Broadway musical, to an upcoming Hollywood adaptation. The filmmakers then went back to their vaults of footage to create part two, THE BEALES OF GREY GARDENS, a tribute both to these indomitable women and to the original landmark documentary’s legions of fans, who have made them American counterculture icons."
"Devils in the outfield! Steeped in occult dread, this experimental documentary uncovers a sinister conspiracy theory surrounding the death of Cleveland baseball player Ray Chapman, who was killed by a ball thrown by Yankees pitcher Carl Mays in 1920."
"Directed by Samantha Nell and Michael Wahrmann • 2016 • South Africa, Brazil
"
"Of the hallowed group of “Cahiers du cinéma” critics turned filmmakers who transformed French film history, Claude Chabrol was the first to direct his own feature. His absorbing landmark debut, LE BEAU SERGE, follows a successful yet sickly young man (Jean‑Claude Brialy) who returns home to the small village where he grew up. There, he finds himself at odds with his former close friend (Gérard Blain)—now unhappily married and a wretched alcoholic—and the provincial life he represents. The remarkable and stark LE BEAU SERGE heralded the arrival of a cinematic titan who would go on to craft provocative, entertaining films for five more decades."
"BEAUTIFUL DAYS (1955, aka Uruwashiki Saigetsu) was one of a series of mainstream dramas and romances made by Kobayashi after his flirtation with independent film making on ROOM WITH THICK WALLS. A romantic drama, it put him back in the success column as a filmmaker, working in the popular realm of his mentor Keisuke Kinoshita, but now without the input of the latter or his relatives; and it also brought Kobayashi together with screenwriter Zenzo Matsuyama, with whom he would enjoy a rich creative partnership (culminating with THE HUMAN CONDITION I, II, and III) over the next few years, as he developed his own style and reputation within the studio system."
"Jean Cocteau’s sublime adaptation of Mme. Leprince de Beaumont’s fairy-tale masterpiece—in which the pure love of a beautiful girl melts the heart of a feral but gentle beast—is a landmark of motion picture fantasy, with unforgettably romantic performances by Jean Marais and Josette Day. The spectacular visions of enchantment, desire, and death in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (LA BELLE ET LA BÊTE) have become timeless icons of cinematic wonder."
"The fourth installment in François Truffaut’s chronicle of the ardent, anachronistic Antoine Doinel, BED AND BOARD plunges his hapless creation once again into crisis. Expecting his first child and still struggling to find steady employment, Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) involves himself in a relationship with a beautiful Japanese woman that threatens to destroy his marriage. Lightly comic, with a touch of the burlesque, BED AND BOARD is a bittersweet look at the travails of young married life and the fine line between adolescence and adulthood."
"The first film made in the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, Milcho Manchevski’s BEFORE THE RAIN crosscuts the stories of an orthodox Christian monk (Grégoire Colin), a British photo agent (Katrin Cartlidge), and a native Macedonian war photographer (Rade Šerbedžija) to paint a portrait of simmering ethnic and religious hatred about to reach its boiling point. Made during the strife of the war-torn Balkan states in the nineties, this gripping triptych of love and violence is also a timeless evocation of the loss of pastoral innocence, and remains one of recent cinema’s most powerful laments on the futility of war."
"In this extraordinary short animation, Evelyn Lambart and Norman McLaren painted colours, shapes, and transformations directly on to their filmstrip. The result is a vivid interpretation, in fluid lines and color, of jazz music played by the Oscar Peterson Trio."
The days leading up to a toddler's second birthday are seen alternately from the child's point of view as well as that of his parents.
"Catherine Deneuve’s porcelain perfection hides a cracked interior in one of the actress’s most iconic roles: Séverine, a Paris housewife who begins secretly spending her after­noon hours working in a bordello. This surreal and erotic late-sixties daydream from provocateur for the ages Luis Buñuel is an examination of desire and fetishistic pleasure (its characters’ and its viewers’), as well as a gently absurdist take on contemporary social mores and class divisions. Fantasy and reality commingle in this burst of cinematic transgression, which was one of Buñuel’s biggest hits."
"Jacques Rivette’s abiding fascination with the interplay between life and art receives one of its most spellbinding treatments in this sensuous, hypnotic exploration of the creative process. Taking its inspiration from a Balzac story, LA BELLE NOISEUSE centers on the tension that arises between an aging painter (Michel Piccoli) and his young model (Emmanuelle Béart) as he obsessively attempts to capture a truth beyond physical reality. Winner of the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, this slow-burn epic is a mesmerizing exploration of the very limits of artistic creation."
A 14-year-old boy obsessed with video begins to detach from reality as his actions become more extreme and violent.
"Just four years before his death, legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman sat down with Swedish documentarian Marie Nyreröd at his home on Fårö Island to discuss his work, his fears, his regrets, and his ongoing artistic passion. This resulted in the most breathtakingly candid series of interviews that the famously reclusive director ever took part in, later edited into the feature-length film BERGMAN ISLAND. In-depth, revealing, and packed with choice anecdotes about Bergman’s oeuvre, as well as his personal life, Nyreröd’s film is an unforgettable final glimpse of a man who transformed cinema."
"“The Punishment Begins”
"
A coming-of-age story about a young girl’s transition from four-legged love objects to two-legged ones.
"Based on the classic Emile Zola novel, Jean Renoir’s LA BÊTE HUMAINE was one of the legendary director’s greatest popular successes, and earned star Jean Gabin a permanent place in the hearts of his countrymen. Part poetic realism, part film noir, the film is a hard-boiled and suspenseful journey into the tormented psyche of a workingman."
"This poignant tale of beauty, identity, and a dress is considered a classic of documentary filmmaking. It was the first independent film of the women’s movement to explore the issues of body image, self-worth, and appearance in American society. In this unconventional documentary, Betty tells her story of the search for the “perfect dress” twice—first as a humorous anecdote and again as her underlying feelings emerge. The contrast between the two stories is haunting."
"Inspired by director Joan Micklin Silver’s time working at New York’s storied alt weekly the “Village Voice,” this unsung gem of 1970s slice-of-life seriocomedy offers an incisive, bittersweet look at a shifting media landscape that feels as fresh and relevant as ever. At the offices of a Boston independent newspaper, the staff members—including music critic Max (Jeff Goldblum, in one of his first leading roles), news reporter Harry (John Heard) and photographer Abbie (Lindsay Crouse)—enjoy a positive and open-minded work environment. However, it seems as though their relatively carefree days are numbered when the owner of a major publishing company buys the paper, leading to more money, but big changes."
"In Rainer Werner Fassbinder's brazen depiction of the alternating currents of lethargy and mayhem inherent in moviemaking, a film crew, played by, and not so loosely based on, his own frequent collaborators, deals with an aloof star (Eddie Constantine), an abusive director (Lou Castel), and a financially troubled production. Inspired by the hellish process of making Whity earlier the same year, this is a vicious look at behind-the-scenes dysfunction."
"BEYOND ALL BARRIERS is another feature-length record of the Seoul 1988 Olympic Games. Made by Lee Ji-won, it boasts a superb color palette and depicts the Opening Ceremony for more than fifty minutes in terms that are visually resplendent."
"With this arresting drama based on notorious real-life events, Cristian Mungiu mounts a complex inquiry into faith, fanaticism, and indifference. At a desolate Romanian monastery, a young novice nun, Voichita (Cosmina Stratan), reunites with her former companion Alina (Cristina Flutur), who plans to take her to Germany. But Voichita proves unwilling to abandon her calling, and Alina becomes increasingly desperate to reclaim her devotion, putting the outsider at odds with the monastery's ascetic priest, and precipitating a painfully misguided, brutal attempt to save her soul. A naturalistic tragedy with the dark force of a folktale, anchored by the fraught dynamic between cinema newcomers Flutur and Stratan (who shared the best actress prize at Cannes), BEYOND THE HILLS bears powerful witness to individuals at cross-purposes and institutions ill-equipped to help those most in need."
"Mailer's belief that we're all capable of being either police or criminals was the impetus for his second feature, which takes place over the course of one feverish night in a Manhattan police precinct and neighboring bar. The texture of the black-and-white stock and the intense depiction of the police lineup process lend the film a rugged, journalistic feel. In addition to Mailer, who cast himself as tough-guy Irish cop Francis Xavier Pope, Beyond the Law features Rip Torn and George Plimpton."
"Banned and destroyed by Stalin in 1937, BEZHIN MEADOW is the story of a boy killed by his father for informing on him. All that survives are the first and last frames of each shot, preserved by Sergei Eisenstein’s wife, Pera Atasheva. The 1967 reconstruction, by Naum Kleiman of the Eisenstein Museum and Sergei Yutkevich of Gosfilmofond, places these frames in order, approximating the original film."
"Hailed around the world as one of the greatest movies ever made, the Academy Award-winning BICYCLE THIEVES, directed by Vittorio De Sica, defined an era in cinema. In poverty-stricken postwar Rome, a man is on his first day of a new job that offers hope of salvation for his desperate family when his bicycle, which he needs for work, is stolen. With his young son in tow, he sets off to track down the thief. Simple in construction and profoundly rich in human insight, BICYCLE THIEVES embodies the greatest strengths of the Italian neorealist movement: emotional clarity, social rectitude, and brutal honesty."
Federico Fellini's IL BIDONE follows a trio of Italian swindlers who resort to petty schemes in order to con poor people out of their money.
Director Ida Lupino stars alongside Edmond O’Brien and Joan Fontaine in this amazingly complex portrait of a weak-willed but sympathetic salesman who spins an elaborate double life with two wives: an upper-crust businesswoman and a tough-talking waitress.
"THE BIG CITY, the great Satyajit Ray’s first portrayal of contemporary life in his native Kolkata, follows the personal triumphs and frustrations of Arati (Madhabi Mukherjee), who decides, despite the initial protests of her bank-clerk husband, to take a job to help support their family. With remarkable sensitivity and attention to the details of everyday working-class life, Ray builds a powerful human drama that is at once a hopeful morality tale and a commentary on the identity of the modern Indian woman."
"Bud Reeves (Eric Linden) does what any young man from a small town would do when he unexpectedly comes into money: he heads to the big city in search of fame and fortune. Amid the bright lights of New York, Reeves finds a group of guys who claim to be his friends, only to fleece him out of his inheritance; a freewheeling chorus girl named Vida (Joan Blondell), to whom he loses his heart; and more trouble than he can handle when a woman dies at a wild party and he’s accused of murder. Featuring a young Humphrey Bogart, this pre-Code firecracker blends broad satire and hard-edged drama."
"The stunning chiaroscuro of cinematographer John Alton suffuses this fascinatingly stylized film noir from B-movie master Joseph H. Lewis. Police Lieutenant Leonard Diamond (Cornel Wilde) is on a personal crusade to bring down sadistic gangster Mr. Brown (Richard Conte). He is also dangerously obsessed with Brown’s girlfriend, the suicidal Susan Lowell (Jean Wallace). When Diamond is officially taken off the case, he nevertheless continues to investigate Brown, a dangerous pursuit that has nothing to do with justice and everything to do with private vendettas borne of submerged desires."
"An all-star cast and jazzy score highlight this charming comedy, a deft satire of classic caper films like RIFIFI. BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET hilariously details the plight of a sad-sack group of bumbling thieves and their desperate attempts to pull off the perfect heist."
"Directed by Mati Diop • 2012 • France
"
"A lighthouse keeper and his family follow work from town to town, each time making new friends and receiving a visit from his troublesome father. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
"A pristine white bathroom soon becomes a site of crimson-stained shaving carnage in Martin Scorsese’s daring student film, a potent and disturbing allegory for the horrors of the Vietnam War."
"Harold Lloyd plays Billy Blazes, a man who attempts to save Peaceful Vale from the violent Crooked Charley."
"Hollis Frampton originally planned to make fourteen Cadenza films for inclusion in the phase The Birth of Magellan. The one presented here, THE BIRTH OF MAGELLAN: CADENZA I, and CADENZA XIV (1977–80) are the only two he completed."
"An idealistic young man attempts to establish a school in a rural location, but encounters opposition from both the black and white communities. Director Oscar Micheaux himself was a former homesteader, and strongly believed that African Americans should establish rural communities rather than follow the urban migration. But it's hard to resist the allure of the city when Micheaux allows energetic singers and dancers to take the nightclub stage for extended musical numbers. The restoration of BIRTHRIGHT was derived from the only known surviving 35 mm print, which is missing the first two of its nine reels - approximately twenty minutes of material. BIRTHRIGHT is a remake of Micheaux's 1924 film of the same title. The earlier version is entirely lost."
"Radically combining collaborative documentary, western, and musical elements, BISBEE ’17 follows several members of a close-knit community as they attempt to reckon with their town’s darkest hour. In 1917, nearly two thousand immigrant miners, on strike for better wages and safer working conditions, were violently rounded up by their armed neighbors, herded onto cattle cars, shipped to the middle of the New Mexican desert, and left there to die. This long-buried and largely forgotten event came to be known as the Bisbee Deportation. BISBEE ’17 documents locals as they reenact scenes from the controversial story, culminating in a large-scale re-creation of the deportation itself on the exact day of its 100th anniversary. What plays out is a complex, multilayered exploration of collective memory that engages provocatively with contemporary political conversations around immigration, labor, environmental damage, corporate corruption, solidarity, and struggle."
"During planting season in Northern Italy’s Po Valley, an earthy rice-field worker (Silvana Mangano) falls in with a small-time criminal (Vittorio Gassman) who is planning a daring heist of the crop, as well as his femme-fatale-ish girlfriend, played by the Hollywood star Doris Dowling. Both a socially conscious look at the hardships endured by underpaid field workers and a melodrama tinged with sex and violence, this early smash for producer extraordinaire Dino De Laurentiis and director Giuseppe De Santis is neorealism with a heaping dose of pulp."
"In the early 1970s, Rainer Werner Fassbinder discovered the American melodramas of Douglas Sirk and was inspired by them to begin working in a new, more intensely emotional register. One of the first and best-loved films of this period in his career is THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT, which balances a realistic depiction of tormented romance with staging that remains true to the director’s roots in experimental theater. This unforgettable, unforgiving dissection of the imbalanced relationship between a haughty fashion designer (Margit Carstensen) and a beautiful but icy ingenue (Hanna Schygulla)—based, in a sly gender reversal, on the writer-director’s own desperate obsession with a young actor—is a true Fassbinder affair, featuring exquisitely claustrophobic cinematography by Michael Ballhaus and full-throttle performances by an all-female cast."
"Duke Ellington makes his first film appearance in this musical drama, in which he plays a struggling bandleader trying to save his piano from bill collectors alongside dancer Fredi Washington and trumpet player Arthur Whetsol. The Ellington Orchestra plays “The Duke Steps Out,” “Black Beauty,” “Black and Tan Fantasy,” and more in a glittering 1920s Harlem nightclub."
"The black balloon, an alien in a crowded land, searches for some semblance of companionship after losing all of its friends."
An eight year old girl and her infant cousin experience a series of traumatic events while quarantined in the infirmary of a residential school for Native children in Canada.
"Ousmane Sembène was one of the greatest and most groundbreaking filmmakers who ever lived, as well as the most renowned African director of the twentieth century—and yet his name still deserves to be better known in the rest of the world. He made his feature debut in 1966 with the brilliant and stirring BLACK GIRL. Sembène, who was also an acclaimed novelist in his native Senegal, transforms a deceptively simple plot—about a young Senegalese woman who moves to France to work for a wealthy white family and finds that life in their small apartment becomes a prison, both figuratively and literally—into a complexly layered critique of the lingering colonialist mind-set of a supposedly postcolonial world. Featuring a moving central performance by M’Bissine Thérèse Diop, BLACK GIRL is a harrowing human drama as well as a radical political statement—and one of the essential films of the 1960s."
The cunning detective Akeichi must foil a kidnapping plot orchestrated by the notorious jewel thief known as Black Lizard.
"Louis Malle meets Lewis Carroll in this bizarre and bewitching trip down the rabbit hole. After skirting the horrors of a mysterious war being waged in the countryside, beautiful young Lily (Cathryn Harrison) takes refuge in a remote farmhouse, where she becomes embroiled in the surreal domestic life of an extremely unconventional family. Evocatively shot by cinematographer Sven Nykvist, BLACK MOON is a Freudian tale of adolescent sexuality set in a postapocalyptic world of shifting identities and talking animals. It is one of Malle’s most experimental films and a cinematic daydream like no other."
"Part film, part baptism, BLACK MOTHER brings us on a spiritual journey through Jamaica. Soaking up its bustling metropolises and tranquil countryside, director Khalik Allah introduces us to a succession of vividly rendered souls who call this island home. Their candid testimonies create a polyphonic symphony, set against a visual prayer of indelible portraiture. Thoroughly immersed in both the sacred and the profane, BLACK MOTHER channels rebellion and reverence into a deeply personal ode informed by Jamaica’s turbulent history but unfolding in the urgent present."
"This explosive work about the conflict between the spirit and the flesh is the epitome of the sensuous style of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. A group of nuns—played by some of Britain’s finest actresses, including Deborah Kerr, Kathleen Byron, and Flora Robson—struggle to establish a convent in the Himalayas, while isolation, extreme weather, altitude, and culture clashes all conspire to drive the well-intentioned missionaries mad. A darkly grand film that won Oscars for Alfred Junge's art direction and Jack Cardiff's cinematography, BLACK NARCISSUS is one of the greatest achievements by two of cinema’s true visionaries."
"Winner of both the Academy Award for best foreign-language film and the Cannes Film Festival’s Palme d’Or, Marcel Camus’ BLACK ORPHEUS (ORFEU NEGRO) brings the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice to the twentieth-century madness of Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. With its eye-popping photography and ravishing, epochal soundtrack, BLACK ORPHEUS was an international cultural event, and it kicked off the bossa nova craze that set hi-fis across America spinning."
"Agnès Varda turns her camera on an Oakland demonstration against the imprisonment of activist and Black Panthers cofounder Huey P. Newton. In addition to evincing Varda’s fascination with her adopted surroundings and her empathy, this perceptive short is also a powerful political statement."
"One of the first films to herald the arrival of the Czechoslovak New Wave, Miloš Forman’s stylistically inventive debut narrative feature follows the bumbling teenager of the title (Ladislav Jakim) over the course of a directionless summer as he starts (and fails at) a new job, flirts awkwardly, and grows increasingly exasperated with his parents. A refreshingly frank, unromanticized coming-of-age portrait, BLACK PETER captures the bewildering experience of adolescence with both empathy and sly humor."
"Perhaps Masaki Kobayashi's most sordid film, BLACK RIVER examines the rampant corruption on and around U.S. military bases in Japan following World War II. Kobayashi spirals out from the story of a love triangle that develops between a good-natured student, his innocent girlfriend, and a coldhearted petty criminal (Tatsuya Nakadai, in his first major role) to reveal a nation slowly succumbing to lawlessness and violence."
"In late 2015, “Bright Ideas” magazine commissioned the Zellner Bros. to make a short piece in response to a Criterion Collection release that they considered inspiring. The brothers chose Louis Malle’s wild, hallucinogenic BLACK MOON (1975)."
"You've probably never seen anything quite like this manic, oddball, anti-buddy picture about a young, jazz-obsessed Japanese drifter and a Black American GI on the lam in Tokyo. The two outsiders become outlaws, and Koreyoshi Kurahara depicts their growing bond as an alternately absurd and tragic culture clash. The film features original music by American jazz drummer Max Roach."
"In this evocative, atmospheric biography, Roberto Rossellini brings to life philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal, who, amid religious persecution and ignorance, believed in a harmony between God and science."
"Scripted and shot by Charles Burnett, Billy Woodberry’s slice-of-life revelation is a key masterpiece of the LA Rebellion, the black independent-cinema renaissance that emerged from UCLA’s film school in the 1970s and ’80s. BLESS THEIR LITTLE HEARTS distills the social concerns and neorealist aesthetics of the movement into a sensitive exploration of the inner workings of community and family that pays homage to the power of the blues. Searching for steady work, Charlie Banks (Nate Hardman) views his chronic unemployment as a kind of spiritual trial. But day work and selling a few catfish can’t sustain a family of five. While his wife Andais (a remarkable Kaycee Moore) works to support them with dignity, Charlie finds comfort for his wounded sense of manhood in an affair that threatens his marriage and family."
"Before he stunned the cinematic world with the epic series DEKALOG and the THREE COLORS trilogy, the great Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieślowski made his first work of metaphysical genius, BLIND CHANCE, a compelling drama about the difficulty of reconciling political ideals with personal happiness. This unforgettable film follows Witek (the magnetic Bogusław Linda), a medical student with an uncertain future in Communist Poland; Kieślowski dramatizes Witek’s journey as a series of different possibilities, suggesting that chance rules our lives as much as choice does. First suppressed and then censored by the Polish government, BLIND CHANCE is here presented in its complete original form."
"BLITHE SPIRIT, David Lean’s delightful film version of Noël Coward’s theater sensation (onstage, it broke London box-office records before hitting Broadway), stars Rex Harrison as a novelist who cheekily invites a medium (Margaret Rutherford) to his house to conduct a séance, hoping the experience will inspire a book he’s working on. Things go decidedly not as planned when she summons the spirit of his dead first wife (Kay Hammond), a severe inconvenience for his current one (Constance Cummings). Employing Oscar-winning special effects to spruce up Coward’s theatrical farce, BLITHE SPIRIT is a sprightly supernatural comedy with winning performances."
"A cult classic of gooey greatness, THE BLOB follows the havoc wreaked on a small town by an outer-space monster with neither soul nor vertebrae, with Steve McQueen playing the rebel teen who tries to warn the residents about the jellylike invader. Strong performances and ingenious special effects help THE BLOB transcend the schlock sci-fi and youth delinquency genres from which it originates. Made outside of Hollywood by a maverick film distributor and a crew whose credits mostly comprised religious and educational shorts, THE BLOB helped launch the careers of McQueen and composer Burt Bacharach, whose bouncy title song is just one of this film’s many unexpected pleasures."
"James Cagney and Joan Blondell match wits in one of the finest of their delightfully risqué early-1930s pairings. He’s a conniving bellhop and she’s a saucy chambermaid who join forces to fleece a jewelry salesman, then take their con to the Big Apple. Pre-Code workhorse Roy Del Ruth directs with plenty of zip and innuendo, while Cagney fires off one of his most oft-imitated lines: “That dirty, double-crossin’ rat!”"
"In one of her all-too-rare leading roles, Joan Blondell stars as a Depression-downtrodden orphan who, after her boss sexually harasses her, quits her job and uses her wits to rise from amateur con artist to ruthless crime boss. Featuring a supporting cast of colorful character actors and plenty of snappy pre-Code dialogue, this rags-to-rackets tale puts a female-driven spin on the gritty Warner Bros. gangster formula."
"The filmography of late movie maverick Herschell Gordon Lewis brims with the mad, macabre, and just downright bizarre. But perhaps the most unhinged of all his directorial efforts, and certainly the most influential, must surely be his original gorefest BLOOD FEAST—the first splatter movie. Dorothy Fremont is looking to throw a party unlike any other, and she gets just that when she hires the decidedly sinister Fuad Ramses to cater the event. Promising to provide her guests with an authentic Egyptian feast, Ramses promptly sets about acquiring the necessary ingredients—the body parts of nubile young women! Featuring a host of stomach-churning gore gags, including the infamous tongue sequence and much more nastiness besides, BLOOD FEAST more than lives up to its name and remains essential viewing for any self-respecting splatter fan."
"The first feature by director/actor Spencer Williams (commonly remembered today as Andy on TV’s “Amos ’n’ Andy”), THE BLOOD OF JESUS is a rural religious parable in which a woman (Cathryn Caviness), accidentally shot by her husband (Williams), travels to the crossroads of the hereafter and faces the temptations of the devil himself. Williams appropriated footage from Roman Freulich’s 1936 inspirational short BROKEN EARTH to add stylish production value to this low-budget drama—but he proves to be quite the stylist himself with the images of the leering Satan and the stunning finale, in which the protagonist falls to the foot of a cross and is bathed in the literal blood of Jesus."
"Directed by Georges Franju • 1949 • France
"
"This taut western thriller marries the mythology of the frontier with the shadowy style and dark psychological undercurrents of film noir. Out on the Texas range, Jim Garry (Robert Mitchum) rides into town, where he quickly falls in with Tate Riling (Robert Preston), an old mercenary friend who uses him as the muscle in a scheme to swindle local cattle rancher John Lufton (Tom Tully) out of his livestock. When Garry falls in love with Lufton’s formidable daughter Amy (Barbara Bel Geddes), though, he finds himself pitted against his former associate in a bloody confrontation."
"This 2016 documentary, directed by Valentina Agostinis on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of BLOW-UP, features the film's dialogue assistant, Piers Haggard, model Jill Kennington, former Yardbirds manager Simon Napier-Bell, photographer David Montgomery, historian Philippe Garner, art historian David Alan Mellor, and several others. The documentary returns to a few key locations and explores director Michelangelo Antonioni's meticulous approach to art and photography."
"Inspired by the groundbreaking use of film in the analysis of movement by physiologist Étienne-Jules Marey, Jean Painlevé animated the opéra bouffe BLUEBEARD, about the legendary knight, using clay dolls made by sculptor René Bertrand and Bertrand’s three young children."
Les Blank creates a vivid portrait of bluesman Lightin’ Hopkins through a vital collection of musical performances and oral histories.
"Although the 1920s brought him acclaim as a stage actor and singer, Paul Robeson still had to prove himself as a viable screen performer. Mainstream avenues were limited, however, and his first films were made on the peripheries of the film business. BODY AND SOUL, directed by the legendary African American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, is a direct critique of the power of the cloth, casting Robeson in dual roles as a jackleg preacher and a well-meaning inventor."
"Though married to the good-natured, beautiful Thérèse (Claire Drouot), young husband and father François (Jean-Claude Drouot) finds himself falling unquestioningly into an affair with an attractive postal worker. One of Agnès Varda’s most provocative films, LE BONHEUR examines, with a deceptively cheery palette and the spirited strains of Mozart, the ideas of fidelity and happiness in a modern, self-centered world."
"Otto Preminger’s second collaboration with the singular Jean Seberg casts her as Cecile, a hedonistic teenager living on the French Riviera with her similarly decadent father Raymond (David Niven), an incorrigible playboy with whom she shares a curious closeness. When Raymond’s relationship with the straitlaced Anne (Deborah Kerr) threatens to upset her idyll, the possessive Cecile takes matters into her own hands. Adapted from the scandalous novel by French writer Françoise Sagan, this sumptuous melodrama combines striking color and black-and-white cinematography to create a mood of intoxicating melancholy."
"Before carving out a niche as one of the most distinct voices in nineties American cinema, Allison Anders made her debut, alongside codirectors and fellow UCLA film school students Kurt Voss and Dean Lent, with 1987’s BORDER RADIO. A low-key, semi-improvised postpunk diary that took four years to complete, BORDER RADIO features legendary rocker Chris D., of the Flesh Eaters, as a singer/songwriter who has stolen loot from a club and gone missing, leaving his wife (Luanna Anders), a no-nonsense rock journalist, to track him down with the help of his friends (John Doe of the band X; Chris Shearer). With its sprawling Southern Californian and Mexican landscapes, captured in evocative 16mm black and white, BORDER RADIO is a singular, DIY memento of the indie film explosion in America."
Patrons of a bar interact on a summer Sunday afternoon.
"The film that rocked the foundations of the 1980s underground, this postpunk provocation is a DIY fantasia of female rebellion set in America ten years after a social-democratic cultural revolution. When Adelaide Norris (Jean Satterfield), the black revolutionary founder of the Woman’s Army, is mysteriously killed, a diverse coalition of women—across all lines of race, class, and sexual orientation—emerges to blow the system apart. Filmed guerrilla style on the streets of pre-gentrification New York, BORN IN FLAMES is a Molotov cocktail of feminist futurism that’s both an essential document of its time and radically ahead of it."
"This groundbreaking short film, which won first prize at the 1963 Touris Film Festival in France, was the directorial debut of Ousmane Sembène."
"Michel Simon gives one of the most memorable performances in screen history as Boudu, a Parisian tramp who takes a suicidal plunge into the Seine and is rescued by a well-to-do bookseller, Edouard Lestingois (Charles Granval). The Lestingois family decides to take in the irrepressible bum, and he shows his gratitude by shaking the household to its foundations. With BOUDU SAVED FROM DROWNING, legendary director Jean Renoir takes advantage of a host of Parisian locations and the anarchic charms of his lead actor to create an effervescent satire of the bourgeoisie."
An ignored housewife takes her mother's advice and changes her behavior in order to gain back the interest of her husband.
"Produced for the French television series POSTCARDS FROM NEW YORK, this short documentary captures the poetry of the city’s storied skid row before its gentrification."
"Toshio, a 10-year-old boy, lives with his father, a shiftless ex-soldier, his stepmother, and his toddler half brother. The family gains a livelihood by means of a swindle in which Toshio's stepmother rushes into the path of oncoming traffic and feigns being struck by a car in order to hound a quick cash ""settlement"" from the driver. Eventually, Toshio is trained to assume her function, and the family moves from city to city to avoid detection. Their nomadic lifestyle isolates Toshio, who often retreats into fantasies. He attempts to run away to his grandmother's house in Kochio, but, unable to afford the fare, he buys a ticket to a less distant location and after sleeping on a beach returns to his parents. With police now alerted to the family's activities, they travel north to snowy Hokkaido. The boy's parents quarrel: his stepmother hopes to gather enough money in a short time to make a better life for them, while his father believes that they should refrain from repeating the swindle until the danger has passed. They discuss separating for a time and argue over who will take Toshio, the breadwinner. The father, in an outburst, flings away the watch Toshio's stepmother has given him. The toddler wanders into the road to retrieve it and causes an accident that results in the deaths of a man and a little girl. Later, the despondent Toshio builds a snowman and tells his little brother of a benevolent man from outer space who will right all wrongs; then, recognizing his own impotence, he attacks the snowman. The family settles down and again moves south, but the police arrest them. Under questioning, the boy admits only that he was in Hokkaido and witnessed the accident."
"Parents usually want the best for their children, but in this Spanish comedy by director Luis Garcia Berlanga they take that concept a bit too far. A young girl travels with her parents to a beach resort with the hope of finding her a suitable husband. Opinions differ as to who would make an ideal partner, but leave it to the meddling parents to be overly involved in the decision making process."
"There has never been another movie like BOYHOOD, from director Richard Linklater. An event film of the utmost modesty, it was shot over the course of twelve years in the director’s native Texas and charts the physical and emotional changes experienced by a child named Mason (Ellar Coltrane), his divorced parents (Patricia Arquette, who won an Oscar for her performance, and Ethan Hawke), and his older sister (Lorelei Linklater). Alighting not on milestones but on the small, in-between moments that make up lives, Linklater fashions a flawlessly acted, often funny portrait that flows effortlessly from one year to the next. Allowing us to watch people age on film with documentary realism while gripping us in a fictional narrative of exquisite everydayness, BOYHOOD has a power that only the art of cinema could harness."
"When a family has to relocate due to the war, they are ostracized by their new community. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
"When Japanese New Wave bad boy Seijun Suzuki delivered this brutal, hilarious, and visually inspired masterpiece to the executives at his studio, he was promptly fired. BRANDED TO KILL tells the ecstatically bent story of a yakuza assassin with a fetish for sniffing steamed rice (the chipmunk-cheeked superstar Joe Shishido) who botches a job and ends up a target himself. This is Suzuki at his most extreme—the flabbergasting pinnacle of his sixties pop-art aesthetic."
"In the dystopian masterpiece BRAZIL, Jonathan Pryce plays a daydreaming everyman who finds himself caught in the soul-crushing gears of a nightmarish bureaucracy. This cautionary tale by Terry Gilliam, one of the great films of the 1980s, has come to be esteemed alongside antitotalitarian works by the likes of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. And in terms of set design, cinematography, music, and effects, BRAZIL is a nonstop dazzler."
"At the turn of the twentieth century, three Australian army lieutenants are court-martialed for alleged war crimes committed while fighting in South Africa. With no time to prepare, an Australian major, appointed as defense attorney, must prove that they were just following orders and are being made into political pawns by the British imperial command. Director Bruce Beresford garnered international acclaim for this riveting drama set during a dark period in his country’s colonial history, and featuring passionate performances by Edward Woodward, Bryan Brown, and Jack Thompson; rugged cinematography by Donald McAlpine; and an Oscar-nominated script, based on true events."
"Lars von Trier became an international sensation with this galvanizing realist fable about sex and spiritual transcendence. In an Oscar-nominated performance, Emily Watson stuns as Bess, a simple, pious newlywed in a tiny Scottish village who gives herself up to a shocking form of martyrdom after her husband (Stellan Skarsgård) is paralyzed in an oil rig accident. BREAKING THE WAVES, both brazen and tender, profane and pure, is an examination of the expansiveness of faith and of its limits."
"There was before BREATHLESS, and there was after BREATHLESS. Jean-Luc Godard burst onto the film scene in 1960 with this jazzy, free-form, and sexy homage to the American film genres that inspired him as a writer for “Cahiers du cinèma.” With its lack of polish, surplus of attitude, anything-goes crime narrative, and effervescent young stars Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, BREATHLESS helped launch the French New Wave and ensured that cinema would never be the same."
"Bernhard Wicki’s astonishing THE BRIDGE was the first major antiwar film to come out of Germany after World War II, as well as the nation’s first postwar film to be widely shown internationally, even securing an Oscar nomination. Set near the end of the conflict, it follows a group of teenage boys in a small town as they contend with everyday matters like school, girls, and parents, before enlisting as soldiers and being forced to defend their home turf in a confused, terrifying battle. This expressively shot, emotionally bruising drama dared to humanize young German soldiers at a historically tender moment, and proved influential for the coming generation of New German Cinema auteurs."
"After a chance meeting on a train platform, a married doctor (Trevor Howard) and a suburban housewife (Celia Johnson) begin a muted but passionate, and ultimately doomed, love affair. With its evocatively fog-enshrouded setting, swooning Rachmaninoff score, and pair of remarkable performances (Johnson was nominated for an Oscar), this film, directed by David Lean and based on Noël Coward’s play “Still Life” deftly explores the thrill, pain, and tenderness of an illicit romance, and has influenced many a cinematic brief encounter since its release."
"Errol Morris turns his camera on one of the most fascinating men in the world: the pioneering astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, afflicted by a debilitating motor neuron disease that has left him without a voice or the use of his limbs. An adroitly crafted tale of personal adversity, professional triumph, and cosmological inquiry, Morris’s documentary examines the way the collapse of Hawking’s body has been accompanied by the untrammeled broadening of his imagination. Telling the man’s incredible story through the voices of his colleagues and loved ones, while making dynamically accessible some of the theories in Hawking’s best-selling book of the same name, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME is at once as small as a single life and as big as the ever-expanding universe."
"Among the most praised and sought-after titles in all contemporary film, this singular masterpiece of Taiwanese cinema, directed by Edward Yang, finally comes to home video in the United States. Set in the early sixties in Taiwan, A BRIGHTER SUMMER DAY is based on the true story of a crime that rocked the nation. A film of both sprawling scope and tender intimacy, this novelistic, patiently observed epic centers on the gradual, inexorable fall of a young teenager (Chen Chang, in his first role) from innocence to juvenile delinquency, and is set against a simmering backdrop of restless youth, rock and roll, and political turmoil."
"At the height of his international acclaim, Ingmar Bergman followed two meditations on death, THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES, with an examination of the mystery and pain of birth. This intimate chamber drama, set in a maternity ward, follows the emotional crises of three women as they grapple with motherhood. Another major success for the director that was also recognized for its exquisite performances by Ingrid Thulin, Eva Dahlbeck, and Bibi Andersson, BRINK OF LIFE is one of Bergman’s most brilliantly nuanced explorations of the inner lives of women."
"When the future of his construction company falls into danger, a controlling father pushes his children into unsatisfying marraiges and careers in order to regain financial stability. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
"A Hollywood-style western with a black cast, THE BRONZE BUCKAROO stars Herb Jeffries as singing cowboy Bob Blake, a smooth, brave, and honorable hero who is assisted by his comic sidekick Dusty, played by Lucius Brooks."
"A disturbed woman is receiving a radical form of psychotherapy at a remote, mysterious institute. Meanwhile, her five-year-old daughter, under the care of her estranged husband, is being terrorized by a group of demonic beings. How these two story lines connect is the shocking and grotesque secret of this bloody tale of monstrous parenthood from David Cronenberg, starring Oliver Reed and Samantha Eggar. With its combination of psychological and body horror, THE BROOD laid the groundwork for many of the director’s films to come, but it stands on its own as a personal, singularly scary vision."
"When the patriarch of the Toda family suddenly dies, his widow discovers that he has left her with nothing but debt and married children who are unwilling to support her--except for her most thoughtful son, just returned from China..."
"Michael Redgrave gives the performance of his career in Anthony Asquith’s adaptation of Terence Rattigan’s unforgettable play. Redgrave portrays Andrew Crocker-Harris, an embittered, middle-aged schoolmaster who begins to feel that his life has been a failure. Diminished by poor health, a crumbling marriage, and the derision of his pupils, the once brilliant scholar is compelled to reexamine his life when a young student offers an unexpected gesture of kindness. A heartbreaking story of remorse and atonement, THE BROWNING VERSION is a classic of British realism and the winner of best actor and best screenplay honors at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival."
"As hard-hitting as its title, BRUTE FORCE was the first of Jules Dassin’s forays into the crime genre, a prison melodrama that takes a critical look at American society as well. Burt Lancaster is the timeworn Joe Collins, who, along with his fellow inmates, lives under the heavy thumb of the sadistic, power-tripping guard Captain Munsey (a riveting Hume Cronyn). Only Collins’s dreams of escape keep him going, but how can he possibly bust out of Munsey’s chains? Matter-of-fact and ferocious, BRUTE FORCE builds to an explosive climax that shows the lengths men will go to when fighting for their freedom."
"This chronicle of the XXI Olympic Winter Games Vancouver 2010 would be Bud Greenspan’s last before his death in 2010. His time-honored approach to these films was by this point familiar, and here he brings a valedictory flourish to his suite of ten Olympic documentaries."
"For his documentary on the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad in Athens, Bud Greenspan decided to take a more selective approach, focusing only on five other disciplines and sports apart from the staple track and field: swimming, softball, fencing, cycling, and weight lifting."
"In addition to covering the XX Olympic Winter Games of 2006 in Turin, Bud Greenspan’s documentary offers an excellent introduction to Turin's significance in history, art, and commerce. Faithful to his habit, the director fleshes out coverage of the actual competitions with interviews and portraits of the principal protagonists."
"This time, Drummond is trying to prevent foreign agents from stealing an experimental aircraft control system vital to England's defense."
"This time out the race against time mounts up, as Drummond's fiancee Phyllis is kidnapped by an old enemy, who is planning something grisly for the both of them (in a death-trapped room and a series of challenges and clues that would tax James Bond)."
"Ray Milland makes his only appearance as Bulldog Drummond in this, the first entry in Paramount's Drummond series. Drummond's sweetheart, Phyllis Clavering (Angel), is abducted by Norman Merridew (Hall), whose friendship with her family takes a back seat to his greedy designs on Phyllis' inheritance. Drummond goes to the eerie manor house where Phyllis is being held, but he's not the only one who ventures there to get to the bottom of the kidnaping; incognito as usual, Scotland Yard inspector Nielson (Standing) is also very much on the case. Other offers and obligations prevented Milland from repeating this role, but here he makes a solid, if somewhat breezy, Drummond."
"Capt. (ret.) Hugh ""Bulldog"" Drummond, with his fiancee Phyllis and valet Algy are off to Africa to help find Hugh's old friend Col. Nielson of Scotland Yard, who has been kidnapped."
"After one near missus after another, the long-waiting Phyllis Clavering (Angel) finally ties the knot with the gallivanting Capt. Hugh ""Bulldog"" Drummond (Howard), but not until he gives chase to Henri Armides (Ciannelli), who has taken it upon himself to liberate a small fortune from a bank. Drummond pursues Armides across the Channel and over French rooftops en route to his wedding rendezvous with Phyllis. Released in the summer of 1939, this weak entry was the last picture in Paramount's Bulldog Drummond series, and the usual players were on hand for the send-off."
"As Drummond and his fiancee are about to tie the knot, the theft of one of their wedding gifts--a synthetic diamond, no less--reveals the existence of a gang of international gem speculators who are willing to kill to control their market."
"Drummond gets wind of a deadly and highly unstable new explosive, and an industrialist who is trying to gain control of it for his own nefarious ends."
Bulldog Drummond's Secret Police begins with Drummond and his fiancee Phyllis planning their lives post-wedding (which hasn't happened yet). But then a series of deaths and an elusive murderer get in the way of their impending happiness.
"World War I fighter pilot, sleuth, race car driver and Olympic athlete Bullshot Crummond must defeat the evil Count Otto van Bruno and save a damsel in distress."
"This 1919 short is the only Harold Lloyd title other than Speedy set in New York City, although it was filmed entirely in Los Angeles. BUMPING INTO BROADWAY was also the first two-reeler to star Lloyd's ""Glasses Character."" This newly restored master features a 2004 score by Robert Israel."
"Duke Ellington presents vocalist Ivie Anderson delivering a plaintive rendition of “Stormy Weather.” Plus: two instrumentals from his orchestra, accompanied by a showstopping routine from Cotton Club dancers Bessie Dudley and Florence Hill."
"A dark musical enacted in a modern marketplace, situated next to a large freeway. The employees of the various commercial venues, portrayed as animals, deal with boredom and existential anxiety by performing cheerful musical turns. The apocalypse is a tempting liberator."
"For nearly five years, acclaimed German filmmaker Werner Herzog desperately tried to complete one of the most ambitious and difficult films of his career, FITZCARRALDO, the story of one man’s attempt to build an opera house deep in the Amazon jungle. Documentary filmmaker Les Blank captured the unfolding of this production, made more perilous by Herzog’s determination to shoot the most daunting scenes without models or special effects, including a sequence requiring hundreds of native Indians to pull a full-size, 320-ton steamship over a small mountain. The result is an extraordinary document of the filmmaking process and a unique look into the single-minded mission of one of cinema’s most fearless directors."
"In Heinosuke Gosho's subtle slice-of-life comedy, an aging couple struggle to pay for their daughters' marriages while keeping their much younger son from feeling left out."
"An Imperial Japanese Army regiment surrenders to British forces in Burma at the close of World War II and finds harmony through song. A private, thought to be dead, disguises himself as a Buddhist monk and stumbles upon spiritual enlightenment. THE BURMESE HARP is an eloquent meditation on beauty coexisting with death and remains one of Japanese cinema’s most overwhelming antiwar statements, both tender and brutal in its grappling with Japan’s wartime legacy."
"Made up of intimate, revelatory footage of the singular author and poet filmed over the course of five years, Howard Brookner’s 1983 documentary about William S. Burroughs was for decades mainly the stuff of legend; that changed when Aaron Brookner, the late director’s nephew, discovered a print of it in 2011 and spearheaded a restoration. Now viewers can enjoy the invigorating candidness of BURROUGHS: THE MOVIE, a one-of-a-kind nonfiction portrait that was brought to life with the help of a remarkable crew of friends, including Jim Jarmusch and Tom DiCillo, and that features on-screen appearances by fellow artists of Burroughs’s including Allen Ginsberg, Herbert Huncke, Patti Smith, and Terry Southern."
"Director Stig Björkman creates a portrait of Ingmar Bergman through behind-the-scenes footage collected over a forty year period, as well as a testament to Bergman's lasting influence through interviews with directors Woody Allen, Olivier Assayas, Martin Scorsese, and others."
"A young photographer and his assistant take pictures of Tibetan nomads. Against diverse and more or less exotic backgrounds, families appear to the photographer. Through these shots, the photographer will weave unique links with each of the various villagers."

The magnetic Cab Calloway plays a ladies’ man who finds time for a dalliance with a train porter’s wife in between lively renditions of favorites like “Zaz-zuh-zaz” and “The Lady with the Fan.”
The Quay Brothers pay homage to another stop-motion master in this surrealist curiosity shop that imagines legendary Czech animator Jan Švankmajer as a mad genius (literally) opening a child’s mind to fantastical experiments in perception.
"Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains pop off the screen in vivid Technicolor in Gabriel Pascal's version of Shaw's 1901 play about love and politics in ancient Rome and Egypt. At the time the most expensive British film ever produced (complete with real imported Egyptian sand), Caesar and Cleopatra is a lavish epic, featuring standout performances by its two stars."
"In the feature film debut by director Mathieu Kassovitz (LA HAINE), a pregnant young woman attempts to determine who is the father of her child."
"When Mihaes’s little boy brings home a sick dove, the creature creates new conflicts between father and son, but also a possible reconciliation that Mihaes does not want to lose."
"This short film, created in 2003 by Andrew Haigh, provides some insight into the director’s evolving vision."
"Morag is 86. She lives alone at the end of a track looking out to sea on her croft on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides, with her three cats and twelve sheep. Morag was born in this house and has lived here her whole life, following five generations of the family who came before her. CAILLEACH is a portrait of Morag and her simple and peaceful life as she contemplates her next chapter, shares her unique sense of independence and the connection she has to her wild island home."
"When he was cutting Phantom India, Louis Malle found that the footage shot in Calcutta was so diverse, intense, and unforgettable that it deserved its own film. The result, released theatrically, is at times shocking--a chaotic portrait of a city engulfed in social and political turmoil, edging ever closer to oblivion."
"Atom Egoyan’s at once witty and devastating investigation of identity, memory, and displacement stars the director as a Canadian photographer who, while on an assignment shooting churches in Armenia, finds himself growing increasingly estranged from his wife (Arsinée Khanjian)—the beginning of a rift that will haunt him into the future. Unfolding in a fragmented, time-scrambling structure and told in part through a telephone answering machine, CALENDAR is a rich and profound reflection on emotional and cultural alienation."
"Bud Greenspan was fascinated by the ways in which athletes confront victory and defeat, and this runs like a bass line through the various interviews he conducted for his tribute to the XV Olympic Winter Games, CALGARY '88: 16 DAYS OF GLORY. Greenspan's diligent archival research enhances his documentaries and sets each athlete's performance in a historical context."
"Neil Simon’s smash Broadway farce hits the screen with a luminous all-star cast. Among the guests whose personal and romantic dilemmas intertwine over the course of their stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel are: Jane Fonda, as a hard-nosed Manhattanite perturbed by her ex-husband Alan Alda’s new California lifestyle; Maggie Smith, who won a real-life Academy Award for her performance as an Oscar-nominated actress in denial about her marriage of convenience to her closeted husband (Michael Caine); Walter Matthau, who must think quick to explain to his wife (Elaine May) how another woman ended up in his bed; and Richard Pryor as a doctor trying—and failing to find—a little rest and relaxation."
"A love letter to the analogue pleasures of an increasingly niche technology, this thought-provoking documentary is a rich, affectionate portrait of artists, writers, and collectors who remain steadfastly loyal to the typewriter as a tool and muse. Featuring interviews with high-profile enthusiasts like Tom Hanks, Sam Shepard, David McCullough, John Mayer, and others, it also movingly documents the struggles of California Typewriter, one of the last repair shops in America dedicated to keeping the aging contraptions clicking. As the digital age’s emphasis on speed and convenience reshapes our relationship to technology, CALIFORNIA TYPEWRITER asks us to consider who’s serving whom: human or machine?"
"Whilst we remain safe and sound, watching the highest grossing cat fail compilation, all that is kept out of sight gets back to us in this consumerist nightmare. On a global playground, without bounds, the cat's body is devoured, exploited and controlled - its fear of pain being stronger than the longing for freedom. Objects are fetishized and subjects made into things that are quantifiable and ready for use. They are the natural resources of a luxury they will never know. We are here because you were there - and waste is dumped in the ocean. In the end, bodies reveal the causes and effects of power, pleasure and hate."
"Usually a reserved guy, Greg struggles to keep up with young, unpredictable Josh on their first date. But as things heat up and spiral out of control, the two men must confront the generational divide that separates them in this cutting and insightful comedy about the divergent experiences of gay men in contemporary America."
"A reflexive meditation on art and documentary and a key film in Krzysztof Kieślowski’s career, CAMERA BUFF follows a factory worker's growing obsession with filmmaking after he captures the birth of his daughter on his new 8 mm camera."
"A boxing match in Brooklyn; life in postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina; the daily routine of a Nigerian midwife; an intimate family moment at home with the director: Kirsten Johnson weaves these scenes and others into her film CAMERAPERSON, a tapestry of footage captured over her twenty-five-year career as a documentary cinematographer. Through a series of episodic juxtapositions, Johnson explores the relationships between image makers and their subjects, the tension between the objectivity and intervention of the camera, and the complex interaction of unfiltered reality with crafted narrative. A work that combines documentary, autobiography, and ethical inquiry, CAMERAPERSON is a moving glimpse into one filmmaker’s personal journey and a thoughtful examination of what it means to train a camera on the world."
"Written, produced, and directed by the late, trailblazing director Horace B. Jenkins and crafted by an entirely African American cast and crew, this luminous, recently rediscovered landmark of American independent cinema is a charmingly laid-back, socially incisive love story set in the heart of Louisiana. It’s there that a forbidden romance between an aspiring writer (Richard Romain) and an ambitious, college-bound woman (Tommye Myrick) lays bare the tensions between two black communities: the wealthy Creoles and the working-class descendants of slaves. Featuring lyrical cinematography and strikingly naturalistic performances from its captivating leads, the long-lost CANE RIVER reemerges thanks to a brand new, state-of-the-art restoration by Indie Collect and Oscilloscope Laboratories."
"One of Mexico's most highly regarded works of political cinema, CANOA: A SHAMEFUL MEMORY reimagines a real-life incident that had occurred just eight years before its release, when a group of urban university employees on a hiking trip were viciously attacked by residents of the village of San Miguel Canoa who had been manipulated by a corrupt priest into believing the travelers were communist revolutionaries. Director Felipe Cazals adopts a gritty documentary style to narrate the events in CANOA while referencing the climate of political repression that would lead to the massacre of student protesters in Mexico City shortly thereafter. The resulting film is a daring commentary on ideological manipulation, religious fanaticism, and mass violence, as well as a visceral expression of horror."
"Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s beloved classic A CANTERBURY TALE is a profoundly personal journey to Powell’s bucolic birthplace of Kent, England. Set amid the tumult of the Second World War, yet with a rhythm as delicate as a lullaby, the film follows three modern-day incarnations of Chaucer’s pilgrims—a melancholy “landgirl,” a plainspoken American GI, and a resourceful British sergeant—who are waylaid in the English countryside en route to the mythical town and forced to solve a bizarre village crime. Building to a majestic climax that ranks as one of the filmmaking duo’s finest achievements, the dazzling A CANTERBURY TALE has acquired a following of devotees passionate enough to qualify as pilgrims themselves."
"Two years after his worldwide hit CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, Jiří Menzel directed this amusing idyll about three middle-aged men whose mellow summer is interrupted by the arrival of a circus performer and his beautiful assistant. A meditation on aging and sex, shot in warm, sun-dappled color, CAPRICIOUS SUMMER is one of the New Wave’s loveliest reveries."
"After a wild bachelor party, a boy finds himself aboard a sailing vessel where he encounters numerous adventures in this short film."
"Adapting the fifth volume of Marcel Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time,” Chantal Akerman transforms the material into a mesmerizing study of voyeurism, control, and sexual obsession centered on the relationship between a possessive young man (Stanislas Merhar) and his passive lover (Sylvie Testud), whom he is convinced is carrying on a lesbian affair. As he relentlessly stalks her every move, the two find themselves imprisoned in a cycle of jealousy, erotic longing, and self-destruction."
"Alec Guinness and Glynis Johns are at their best in THE CARD, a story of an enterprising young man determined to succeed in a hard, cruel world. In the course of his upward climb, he meets an equally sharp-witted and conscienceless young dancing-school director. Their various entanglements are happy combinations of the romantic and the treacherous . . . until Guinness’s “card” plays one last, surprising trick."
"CAREER GIRLS looks at two thirty-year-old career women who meet up after a long period apart and rediscover the relationship they enjoyed when they shared an apartment years ago. Moving, sad and funny, it’s a film about love and youth and sex and memories."

"Carmen falls in love with an artist in this sequel to Carmen Comes Home, noted for its canted camera angles. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
A small village in Flanders puts on a carnival to avoid the brutal consequences of the Spanish occupation.
"A young woman (Candace Hilligoss) in a small Kansas town survives a drag race accident, then agrees to take a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City. En route, she is haunted by a bizarre apparition that compels her toward an abandoned lakeside pavilion. Made by industrial filmmakers on a small budget, the eerily effective B-movie classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS was intended to have “the look of a Bergman and the feel of a Cocteau”—and, with its strikingly used locations and spooky organ score, it succeeds. Herk Harvey’s macabre masterpiece gained a cult following on late-night television and continues to inspire filmmakers today."
"“I thought of the film as a set of ironies upon the form of the art history through its little vocabulary of images; the language is there as a kind of empty sign of the distraction of the lecturing voice, which, if you’re actually looking at the images, goes in one ear and out the other. Of course, the first time anybody ever looked at the film out of my control, they immediately ran the track backwards.” - Hollis Frampton"
"The small town of Paris, Australia, deliberately causes car accidents, then salvages and sells all valuables from the wrecks."

William Kerwin (BLOOD FEAST) and Harvey Korman slice a variety of meats in this educational short film by Herschell Gordon Lewis.
"Jacques Becker lovingly evokes the belle epoque Parisian demimonde in this classic tale of doomed romance. When gangster’s moll Marie (Simone Signoret) falls for reformed criminal Manda (Serge Reggiani), their passion incites an underworld rivalry that leads inexorably to treachery and tragedy. With poignant, nuanced performances and sensuous black-and-white photography, CASQUE D'OR (GOLDEN MARIE) is Becker at the height of his cinematic powers, a romantic masterpiece."
Michael Haneke's adaptation of Franz Kafka's absurdist novel follows a land surveyor as he struggles with the increasingly difficult and bureaucratic practices of the local authorities.
Two detectives investigate the seemingly random murder of an old man found bludgeoned to death in a Tokyo rail yard.
"All kinds of people are waiting in seven different queues. The first person of each queue becomes the last of the next one, thus creating an enormous human line. But at the end of the line, it all begins backwards again."
Harold Lloyd plays a man raised by Chinese missionaries who is brought in to help a corrupt boss run for Mayor in an American city.
"“Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” meets the freewheeling invention of French New Wave gamesman Jacques Rivette in this giddy surrealist fantasia. When magician Céline (Juliet Berto) meets librarian Julie (Dominique Labourier), it’s not long before they are launched through the looking glass and straight into a labyrinthine comic adventure involving a haunted house, psychotropic candy, and a murder mystery as, all the while, the line between illusion and reality grows ever fainter."
"Alain Delon plays a master thief, fresh out of prison, who crosses paths with a notorious escapee (Gian Maria Volonté) and an alcoholic ex-cop (Yves Montand). The unlikely trio plot a heist, against impossible odds, until a relentless inspector and their own pasts seal their fates. Jean-Pierre Melville’s LE CERCLE ROUGE combines honorable antiheroes, coolly atmospheric cinematography, and breathtaking set pieces to create a masterpiece of crime cinema."
"Catherine (Jacqueline Bisset) hires the illiterate Sophie (Sandrine Bonnaire) as her maid. But Sophie soon falls under the influence of the mysterious postal worker Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert), and the stage is set for a tale of murder, violence, and betrayal. This late-career triumph from Claude Chabrol exemplifies the New Wave auteur’s mastery of suspense and twisted psychodrama."
The youngest generation of a Japanese family are forced to submit to a series of cruelly-enforced family traditions.
"The expanses of the American West take center stage in this intimately observed triptych from Kelly Reichardt. Adapted from three short stories by Maile Meloy and unfolding in self-contained but interlocking episodes, CERTAIN WOMEN navigates the subtle shifts in personal desire and social expectation that unsettle the circumscribed lives of its characters: a lawyer (Laura Dern) forced to subdue a troubled client; a wife and mother (Michelle Williams) whose plans to construct her dream home reveal fissures in her marriage; and a night-school teacher (Kristen Stewart) who forms a tenuous bond with a lonely ranch hand (Lily Gladstone), whose longing for connection delivers an unexpected jolt of emotional immediacy. With unassuming craft, Reichardt captures the rhythms of daily life in small-town Montana through these fine-grained portraits of women trapped within the landscape’s wide-open spaces."
"The great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami travels to Tuscany for a luminous and provocative romance in which nothing is as it appears. What seems at first to be a straightforward tale of two people—played by Oscar-winning actress Juliette Binoche and opera singer William Shimell—getting to know each other over the course of an afternoon gradually reveals itself as something richer, stranger, and trickier: a mind-bending reflection on authenticity, in art as well as in relationships. Both cerebrally and emotionally engaging, CERTIFIED COPY reminds us that love itself is an enigma."
"In the final chapter of The Marseille Trilogy, Marcel Pagnol returns his compassionate gaze to his weathered characters as they discover the possibility of reconciliation and the durability of love. Leaping forward twenty years, the trilo'gy continues with the death of Fanny's husband, Panisse, and the discovery of her secret by her son, Césariot. The young man resolves to track down his biological father, Marius, whose life has been fraught with calamity and poverty. The only film in the trilogy written expressly for the screen and directed by Pagnol, CÉSAR resolves the protagonists' star-crossed destinies with the garrulous wit and understated naturalism that have made this epic love story a landmark of humanist filmmaking."
"This riot of bad taste was a breakthrough for Robert Downey Sr., thanks to rave notices. Visualized largely in still 35 mm photographs, it follows a shiftless downtown Manhattanite having his “annual November breakdown” as he wanders from one odd job to the next, coming across all sorts of sordid types, from a desperate independent filmmaker to a destitute dirty-sock sniffer. And there is something to offend everyone: incest, murder, bad pop songs, you name it."
"After years of making mostly comedies and literary adaptations, Raffaello Matarazzo turned to melodrama with this intense tale of a tight-knit working-class family shattered by temptation. There's a touch of noir in CHAINS, in which the saintly yet earthy Yvonne Sanson, as the devoted wife of a mechanic (Amedeo Nazzari), finds herself unwillingly drawn back to an ex-love who has turned to crime."
"This 1957 experimental short, codirected by Claude Jutra and Norman McLaren, shows Jutra’s daring and original approach to filmmaking early on in his career."
"Two explorers lead rival assaults in 1865 on the previously unconquered Matterhorn, resulting in triumph, tragedy, and a quest for redemption. The direction of mountaineer-turned-filmmaker (and actor) Luis Trenker, coupled with a screenplay co-authored by Emeric Pressberger (The Red Shoes) gave this fact-based film a harrowing visual and emotional realism that's still striking seven decades later."
"In Chantal Akerman's early short film LA CHAMBRE, we see the furniture and clutter of one small apartment room become the subject of a moving still life, with Akerman herself staring back at us. This breakthrough formal experiment is the first film the director made in New York."
"Produced for French television’s CINEASTES DE NOTRE TEMPS series, this revealing self-portrait from Chantal Akerman unfolds in two parts. First, Akerman, in her apartment, offers a deeply personal, sometimes funny, always thoughtful account of the problems she encountered making her films. Part two lets Akerman’s films speak for her, weaving together clips from her extensive filmography and linking them until they form a new film. The result is a radically original work that redefines the form of the artist documentary."
Poetic and aesthetic visit of a large polystyrene factory.
"One of the most powerful films to address Australia’s history of racism and exploitation of its Indigenous people, Fred Schepisi’s acclaimed adaptation of the novel by Thomas Keneally follows the downward spiral of its title character (Tommy Lewis), a half-Aboriginal, half-white young man whose mistreatment at the hands of a white family he marries into pushes him to the breaking point. Inspired by a shocking true story that took place in 1900, THE CHANT OF JIMMIE BLACKSMITH is a searing and subversive attack on a shameful national legacy."
A jilted man rants at his mostly silent former lover.
"The most popular children’s book of all time made it to the screen with E. B. White’s heartwarming vision fully intact courtesy of animation powerhouse Hanna-Barbera and the vocal talent of Debbie Reynolds. She plays the beloved spider whose bond with a runt pig yields timeless truths about friendship, cycles of life, and growing up. With handsome hand-drawn animation, songs by Disney mainstays the Sherman Brothers, and a vocal cast that also includes Paul Lynde and Agnes Moorehead, that’s some pig, indeed!"
"Satyajit Ray’s exquisite story of a woman’s artistic and romantic yearning takes place in late nineteenth-century, pre-independence India, in the gracious home of a liberal-minded, workaholic newspaper editor and his lonely wife, Charulata (Madhabi Mukherjee). When her husband’s poet cousin (Soumitra Chatterjee) comes to stay with them, Charulata finds herself both creatively inspired and dangerously drawn to him. Based on a novella by the great Rabindranath Tagore, CHARULATA is a work of subtle textures, a delicate tale of a marriage in jeopardy and a woman taking the first steps toward establishing her own voice."
"Through his singular, freewheeling animation style, Bill Plympton weaves an emotionally rich, unconventional tale of love, jealousy, and reconciliation. In a fateful bumper-car collision, Jake and Ella meet and become the most loving couple in the long history of romance. But when a scheming “other” woman drives a wedge of jealousy into their perfect courtship, insecurity and hatred seemingly doom their affair. With the help of a disgraced magician and his forbidden “soul machine,” Ella takes on the form of Jake’s numerous lovers, desperately fighting through the dysfunction and deceit as they try to reclaim their destiny."
"After his friend suffers a fatal heart attack, Ray Macklin becomes convinced that every ache and pain he experiences brings him one step closer to death."
"Far from a conventional biopic, Steven Soderbergh’s film about Che Guevara is a fascinating exploration of the revolutionary as icon. Daring in its refusal to make the socialist leader into an easy martyr or hero, CHE paints a vivid, naturalistic portrait of the man himself (Benicio Del Toro, in a stunning, Cannes-award-winning performance), from his overthrow of the Batista dictatorship to his 1964 United Nations trip to the end of his short life. Composed of two parts, the first a kaleidoscopic view of the Cuban Revolution and the second an all-action dramatization of Che’s failed campaign in Bolivia, CHE is Soderbergh’s most epic vision."
"Bosnia, 1993. When she sets out to save her pet chicken from being killed, six-year-old Selma inadvertently puts her family in grave danger in this searing look at growing up during wartime."
This short film by Richard Leacock and Noel E. Parmentel Jr. was made in 1968.
"Jean Renoir's ruthless love triangle tale, his second sound film, is a true precursor to his brilliantly bitter THE RULES OF THE GAME, displaying all of the filmmaker's visual genius and fully imbued with his profound humanity. Michel Simon cuts a tragic figure as an unhappily married cashier and amateur painter who becomes so smitten with a prostitute that he refuses to see the obvious: that she and her pimp boyfriend are taking advantage of him. Renoir's elegant compositions and camera movements carry this twisting narrative, a stinging commentary on class and sexual divisions, to an unforgettably ironic conclusion."
"A very early Vittorio de Sica effort, THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US was originally released in Italy as I BAMBINI CI GUARDANO. Director De Sica collaborated with another neorealist pioneer Cesar Zavattini on the screenplay. The film, a morbid melodrama, concerns a young mother who can’t stand the pressures exerted on her by family responsibilities. She deserts her husband and her brood, causing destruction to rain upon them all. Avoiding the rococo gestures and dramatic overstatement that might have attended this film had it been made in Hollywood, De Sica fashions a subtle tale about real people caught up in a real situation. De Sica’s sensitivity towards the younger cast members of THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US would manifest itself in many of his formative films, notably SCIUSCIA and THE BICYCLE THIEF. Made in 1942, the film was not released in Italy until 1944."
A doctor who was widowed during the bombing of Nagasaki decides to write his memoirs before he succumbs to radiation sickness. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"Poetic realism reached sublime heights with CHILDREN OF PARADISE, widely considered one of the greatest French films of all time. This nimble depiction of nineteenth-century Paris’s theatrical demimonde, filmed during World War II, follows a mysterious woman (Arletty) loved by four different men (all based on historical figures): an actor, a criminal, a count, and, most poignantly, a mime (Jean-Louis Barrault, in a longing-suffused performance for the ages). With sensitivity and dramatic élan, director Marcel Carné and screenwriter Jacques Prévert resurrect a world teeming with hucksters and aristocrats, thieves and courtesans, pimps and seers. "
"The torrid love affair between two of nineteenth-century France’s most renowned—and scandalous—literary figures is brought to sumptuous life in this ravishing historical romance. George Sand (Juliette Binoche) is a celebrated writer known as much for her gender-bending, bohemian lifestyle as for her daring, protofeminist novels. Alfred de Musset (Benoît Magimel) is a poet with a reputation as a dandy and a womanizer. Their passionate, stormy relationship will take them from the salons of Paris to the canals of Venice and inspire the creation of some of their most enduring masterpieces."
"The crowning achievement of Orson Welles’s extraordinary cinematic career, CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT was the culmination of the filmmaker’s lifelong obsession with Shakespeare’s ultimate rapscallion, Sir John Falstaff. Usually a comic supporting figure, Falstaff—the loyal, often soused friend of King Henry IV’s wayward son Prince Hal—here becomes the focus: a robustly funny and ultimately tragic screen antihero played by Welles with looming, lumbering grace. Integrating elements from both “Henry IV” plays as well as “Richard II,” “Henry V,” and “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” Welles created a gritty and unorthodox Shakespeare film as a lament, he said, “for the death of Merrie England.” Poetic, philosophical, and visceral—with a kinetic centerpiece battle sequence that rivals anything in the director’s body of work—CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT is as monumental as the figure at its heart."
"An Emperor and a princess, both desperate for the life of a free-spirited wanderer, attempt to escape from the royal palace. The princess, disguised as a man, finds herself attracting the attention of a boorish restaurant owner."
"A husband and wife lie to each other about their weekend travel plans, only to both show up at the family's country house with their lovers."
"Two young, frustrated single mothers join forces to make a new kind of family unit for themselves and their children."
"In Arnaud Desplechin’s beguiling A CHRISTMAS TALE (UN CONTE DE NOËL), Catherine Deneuve brings her legendary poise to the role of Junon, matriarch of the troubled Vuillard family, who come together at Christmas after she learns she needs a bone marrow transplant from a blood relative. That simple family reunion setup, however, can’t begin to describe the unpredictable, emotionally volatile experience of this film, an inventive, magical drama that’s equal parts merriment and melancholy. Unrequited childhood loves and blinding grudges, brutal outbursts and sudden slapstick, music, movies, and poetry, A CHRISTMAS TALE ties it all together in a marvelously messy package."
"Christo and Jeanne Claude's first grand-scale urban project, wrapping the oldest bridge in Paris - the same bridge where Christo courted Jeanne-Claude. A love story set in the heart of Paris: between a refugee artist and a French General's daughter; between a 400-year-old bridge and the people of Paris."
"Nominated for an Academy Award, CHRISTO'S VALLEY CURTAIN celebrates the Bulgarian-born artist's dramatic hanging of a huge orange curtain between two Colorado mountains. Since the late 1950's, Christo's large-scale temporary works of art have helped change our perception of art and society."
"Few films can claim as much influence on the course of cinema history as CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER. The fascinating result of a collaboration between filmmaker-anthropologist Jean Rouch and sociologist Edgar Morin, this vanguard work of what Morin termed cinéma- vérité is a brilliantly conceived and realized sociopolitical diagnosis of the early sixties in France. Simply by interviewing a group of Paris residents in the summer of 1960—beginning with the provocative and eternal question “Are you happy?” and expanding to political issues, including the ongoing Algerian War—Rouch and Morin reveal the hopes and dreams of a wide array of people, from artists to factory workers, from an Italian émigré to an African student. CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER’s penetrative approach gives us a document of a time and place with extraordinary emotional depth."
"The whiplash, double-pronged CHUNGKING EXPRESS is one of the defining works of nineties cinema and the film that made Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai an instant icon. Two heartsick Hong Kong cops (Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony Leung), both jilted by ex-lovers, cross paths at the Midnight Express take-out restaurant stand, where the ethereal pixie waitress Faye (Faye Wong) works. Anything goes in Wong’s gloriously shot and utterly unexpected charmer, which cemented the sex appeal of its gorgeous stars and forever turned canned pineapple and the Mamas and the Papas’ “California Dreamin’” into tokens of romantic longing."
"In this remarkable 1970 documentary, Gideon Bachmann captures Federico Fellini at work on the set of FELLINI SATYRICON."
"In this uplifting romantic drama, the wife of a mechanic and former fighter pilot falls in love with the idea of flying herself. This soon becomes an obsession, and she undertakes a lofty feat: the longest solo flight ever made by a woman. A warm look at a working-class family as well as a triumphant tale of determination, LE CIEL EST À VOUS was Jean Grémillon's most financially successful film."
"The release of Lucrecia Martel’s LA CIÉNAGA heralded the arrival of an astonishingly vital and original voice in Argentine cinema. With a radical and disturbing take on narrative, beautiful cinematography, and a highly sophisticated use of on- and offscreen sound, Martel turns her tale of a dissolute bourgeois extended family, whiling away the hours of one sweaty, sticky summer, into a cinematic marvel. This visceral take on class, nature, sexuality, and the ways that political turmoil and social stagnation can manifest in human relationships is a drama of extraordinary tactility, and one of the great contemporary film debuts."
"Grateful for a respite from his imploding marriage, Hamburg newspaperman Georg (Bruno Ganz) arrives in Beirut to chronicle the bloody Lebanese Civil War. Inside a shell-pitted hotel, Georg and his photographer colleague Hoffman (cult director Jerzy Skolimowski) join a cynical international coterie of competitive fellow journalists. When Georg’s affair with a beautiful German expat (Hanna Schygulla) evolves into something more than an indulgence, Beirut’s whirlpool of brutality threatens to demolish Georg’s neutrality and self-control. Without taking sides or pulling punches, Volker Schlöndorff’s meticulous direction renders both the lethal chaos of urban warfare and the moral tug-of-war of modern Middle Eastern politics with sensitive precision."
"In the last film he made during the silent era, Charlie Chaplin revels in the art of the circus, paying tribute to the acrobats and pantomimists who inspired his virtuoso pratfalls. After being mistaken for a pickpocket, Chaplin’s Tramp flees into the ring of a traveling circus and soon becomes the star of the show, falling for the troupe’s bareback rider along the way. Despite its famously troubled production, this gag-packed comedy ranks among Chaplin’s finest, thanks to some of the most audacious set pieces of the director-performer’s career, including a close brush with a lion and a climactic tightrope walk with a barrelful of monkeys. THE CIRCUS, which was rereleased in 1969 with a new score by Chaplin, is an uproarious high-wire act that showcases silent cinema’s most popular entertainer at the peak of his comic powers."
"CITY LIGHTS, the most cherished film by Charlie Chaplin, is also his ultimate Little Tramp chronicle. The writer-director-star achieved new levels of grace, in both physical comedy and dramatic poignancy, with this silent tale of a lovable vagrant falling for a young blind woman who sells flowers on the street (a magical Virginia Cherrill) and mistakes him for a millionaire. Though this Depression-era smash was made after the advent of sound, Chaplin remained steadfast in his love for the expressive beauty of the pre-talkie form. The result was the epitome of his art and the crowning achievement of silent comedy."
"“Why would I tie myself to one woman?” asks Jerôme in CLAIRE’S KNEE, though he plans to marry a diplomat’s daughter by summer’s end. He spends his July at a lakeside boardinghouse, nursing crushes on the sixteen-year-old Laura and, more tantalizingly, her long-legged, blonde, older half sister, Claire. Baring her knee on a ladder under a blooming cherry tree, Claire unwittingly incites a moral crisis for Jerôme while creating an image that is both the iconic emblem of Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales and one of French cinema’s most enduring moments."
"Lodge Kerrigan began his succession of utterly unique, visually and aurally dazzling character studies with the raw, ravaging CLEAN, SHAVEN. A compelling headfirst dive into the mindscape of a schizophrenic (played by the remarkable Peter Greene) as he tries to track down his daughter after he is released from an institution, Kerrigan’s film brilliantly uses sound and image to lead audiences into a terrifying subjectivity. No one is left unscathed."
"Agnès Varda eloquently captures Paris in the sixties with this real-time portrait of a singer (Corinne Marchand) set adrift in the city as she awaits test results of a biopsy. A chronicle of the minutes of one woman’s life, CLÉO FROM 5 TO 7 is a spirited mix of vivid vérité and melodrama, featuring a score by Michel Legrand (THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG) and cameos by Jean-Luc Godard and Anna Karina."
"At a village railway station in occupied Czechoslovakia, a bumbling dispatcher’s apprentice longs to liberate himself from his virginity. Oblivious to the war and the resistance that surrounds him, this young man embarks on a journey of sexual awakening and self-discovery, encountering a universe of frustration, eroticism, and adventure within his sleepy backwater depot. Wry and tender, Academy Award–winning CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS is a masterpiece of human observation and one of the best-loved films of the Czech New Wave."
"A Polish couple on the cusp of celebrating their forty-fifth anniversary confronts still-fresh emotional wounds in this tender documentary exploration of commitment, betrayal, and forgiveness."
"Erik Skjoldbjærg was the first Norwegian to attend the National Film and Television School in London, where he graduated in 1994. While there, he directed a number of short films, including CLOSE TO HOME."
"Internationally revered Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami has created some of the most inventive and transcendent cinema of the past thirty years, and CLOSE-UP is his most radical, brilliant work. This fiction-documentary hybrid uses a sensational real-life event—the arrest of a young man on charges that he fraudulently impersonated the well-known filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf—as the basis for a stunning, multilayered investigation into movies, identity, artistic creation, and existence, in which the real people from the case play themselves. With its universal themes and fascinating narrative knots, CLOSE-UP has resonated with viewers around the world."
"Through oral histories and images of clothes crisscrossing backyards, Roberta Cantow looks at laundry as a form of folk art, a fraught social signifier, and a medium for women to reflect on the joys, pains, and ambivalences of household chores."
"Directed by the visionary Bengali filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak, THE CLOUD-CAPPED STAR tells the story of a family who have been uprooted by the Partition of India and come to depend on their eldest daughter, the self-sacrificing Neeta (Supriya Choudhury). She watches helplessly as her own hopes and desires are pushed aside time and again by those of her siblings and parents, until all her chances for happiness evaporate, leaving her crushed and ailing. Experimenting with off-balance compositions, discontinuous editing, and a densely layered soundtrack, Ghatak devised an intellectually ambitious and emotionally devastating new shape for the melodrama, lamenting the tragedies of Indian history and the inequities of traditional gender roles while blazing a formal trail for the generations of Indian filmmakers who have followed him."
"This multilayered, immensely entertaining drama from the great contemporary French director Olivier Assayas is a singular look at the intersection of high art and popular culture. The always extraordinary Juliette Binoche is stirring as Maria, a stage and screen icon who is being courted to star in a new production of the play that made her famous—only this time she must assume the role of the older woman. Kristen Stewart matches her punch for punch as her beleaguered assistant, called upon to provide support both professional and emotional for her mercurial boss. And Chloë Grace Moretz is Maria’s callow new castmate, a starlet waiting in the wings. An amorphous, soul-searching tale, filled with ethereal images of its Swiss Alps setting, CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA brilliantly dramatizes one woman’s reckoning with herself and the world."
"A lost soul stumbles drunkenly through the city at night. In a park, Death finds him and shows him many things. This multi-award-winning animated short film begins as a chilling cautionary tale but ends on a heartwarming note."
"One of the world’s most influential and provocative filmmakers, the Oscar–winning Austrian director Michael Haneke diagnoses the social maladies of contemporary Europe with devastating precision and artistry. His drama CODE UNKNOWN, the first of his many films made in France, may be his most inspired work. Composed almost entirely of brilliantly shot, single-take vignettes focusing on characters connected to one seemingly minor incident on a Paris street, Haneke’s film—with an outstanding international cast headlined by Juliette Binoche—is a revelatory examination of racial inequality and the failure of communication in an increasingly diverse modern landscape."
"Randy Quaid portrays an overly Zen taxi driver whose passenger is just trying to find a place to bury his date's dead dog, Jasper."
"An acclaimed early work by Olivier Assayas, the long-unavailable, deeply felt coming-of-age drama COLD WATER can at last be seen in the United States. Drawing from his own youthful experiences, Assayas revisits the outskirts of Paris in the early 1970s, telling the story of teenage lovers Gilles (Cyprien Fouquet) and Christine (Virginie Ledoyen), whose rebellions against family and society threaten to tear them apart. The visceral realism of the movie’s narrative and the near experimentalism of its camera work come together effortlessly thanks in part to a rock soundtrack that vividly evokes the period. COLD WATER, whose centerpiece is one of the most memorable party sequences ever committed to film, is a heartbreaking immersion in the emotional tumult of being young."
"A bombastic, womanizing art dealer and his painter friend go to a seventeenth-century villa on the Riviera for a relaxing summer getaway. But their idyll is disturbed by the presence of the bohemian Haydée, accused of being a “collector” of men. Eric Rohmer’s first color film, LA COLLECTIONNEUSE pushes Six Moral Tales into new, darker realms while showcasing the clever, delectably ironic battle-of-the-sexes repartee (in a script written by Rohmer and the three main actors) and effortlessly luscious Nestor Almendros photography that would define the remainder of the series."
"For the third and final installment in his infamous Blood Trilogy, splatter-movie pioneer Herschell Gordon Lewis turned to the world of fine art for this tortured tale of a troubled artist turned homicidal maniac. Painter Adam Sorg has found himself in a bit of a creative lull. But when his girlfriend accidentally cuts her finger, he realizes what his work has been missing all this time—human blood! With pressure mounting from a local gallery owner to deliver his next masterpiece, Adam sets about procuring as much glorious hemoglobin as he can muster—first from himself, then from anyone unfortunate enough to pass by his sickening studio of slaughter. The final filmic collaboration between Lewis and producer/master exploiteer David F. Friedman, who collectively delivered the equally demented BLOOD FEAST and TWO THOUSAND MANIACS!, COLOR ME BLOOD RED is a crazed creation that truly puts the pain in painting!"
"A breathtaking fusion of poetry, ethnography, and cinema, Sergei Parajanov’s masterwork overflows with unforgettable images and sounds. In a series of tableaux that blend the tactile with the abstract, THE COLOR OF POMEGRANATES revives the splendors of Armenian culture through the story of the eighteenth-century troubadour Sayat-Nova, charting his intellectual, artistic, and spiritual growth through iconographic compositions rather than traditional narrative. The film’s tapestry of folklore and metaphor departed from the realism that dominated the Soviet cinema of its era, leading authorities to block its distribution, with rare underground screenings presenting it in a restructured form. This edition features the cut closest to Parajanov’s original vision, in a restoration that brings new life to one of cinema’s most enigmatic meditations on art and beauty."
"Many of the lost souls of OSSOS and In VANDA’S ROOM return in the spectral landscape of COLOSSAL YOUTH, which brings to Pedro Costa’s Fontainhas films a new theatrical, tragic grandeur. This time, Costa focuses on Ventura, an elderly immigrant from Cape Verde living in a low-cost housing complex in Lisbon, who has been abandoned by his wife and spends his days visiting his neighbors, whom he considers his “children.” What results is a form of ghost story, a tale of derelict, dispossessed people living in the past and present at the same time, filmed by Costa with empathy and startling radiance."
"Based on an unrealized film script written in 1964 for The Homosexual Law Reform Society, a British organization that campaigned for the decriminalization of homosexual relations between men, THE COLOUR OF HIS HAIR merges drama and documentary into an impressionistic meditation on queer life before and after the partial legalization of homosexuality in 1967."
"One of Japanese cinema’s supreme emulations of American noir, Takashi Nomura’s A COLT IS MY PASSPORT is a down-and-dirty but gorgeously photographed yakuza film starring Joe Shishido as a hard-boiled hit man caught between rival gangs. Featuring an incredible, spaghetti-western-style soundtrack and brimming with formal experimentation, this is Nikkatsu at its finest."
"When a renowned architecture scholar falls suddenly ill during a speaking tour, his son, Jin (John Cho), finds himself stranded in Columbus, Indiana, a small Midwestern city celebrated for its many significant modernist buildings. Jin strikes up a friendship with Casey (Haley Lu Richardson), a young architecture enthusiast who works at the local library. As their intimacy develops, Jin and Casey explore both the town and their emotional baggage: Jin’s estranged relationship with his father and Casey’s reluctance to leave Columbus and her mother. With its naturalistic rhythms and empathy for the complexities of families, the debut feature from Kogonada unfolds as a gently drifting, deeply absorbing exploration of the ways physical space can affect our emotions."
"Based on a fragment of text by the Swiss writer Robert Walser, this mesmerizing blend of live action and animation is an exploration of the subconscious visualized as a labyrinthine playhouse haunted by a doll-like explorer and bathed in a gorgeous golden glow."
"This legendary film from Soviet director Elem Klimov is a senses-shattering plunge into the dehumanizing horrors of war. As Nazi forces encroach on his small village in Belorussia, teenage Flyora (Alexei Kravchenko, in a searing depiction of anguish) eagerly joins the Soviet resistance. Rather than the adventure and glory he envisioned, what he finds is a waking nightmare of unimaginable carnage and cruelty—rendered with a feverish, otherworldly intensity by Klimov’s subjective camera work and expressionistic sound design. Nearly blocked from being made by Soviet censors, who took seven years to approve its script, COME AND SEE is perhaps the most visceral, impossible-to-forget antiwar film ever made."
"This devastating drama lays bare the tensions beneath the rosy surface of 1950s America. Shirley Booth, reprising her Tony Award–winning Broadway turn, won a best actress Oscar for her film debut, playing the delusional, sad-sack Lola, whose loveless marriage to the unfulfilled, recovering alcoholic Doc (Burt Lancaster) reaches a crisis point when he takes an interest in their flirtatious young boarder (Terry Moore). Adapted from William Inge’s scorching stage play, COME BACK, LITTLE SHEBA imbues middle-class American angst with the dimensions of Greek tragedy."
"In the early 1970's, ten teenagers (five boys and five girls) leave behind parents, school, and all other authority figures to live on a farm for ten weeks. What emerges in front of Allan King's cameras are the fears, hopes, and alienation of a disillusioned generation. Come On Children is a swift, vivid rendering of the growing pains of a counterculture."
"Two couples are drawn into a dark psychosexual vortex in Paul Schrader’s stylish take on the erotic thriller. Rupert Everett and Natasha Richardson are a British couple hoping to repair their rocky relationship while on vacation in Venice, where they fall in with a wealthy, mysterious couple (Christopher Walken and Helen Mirren) whose fascination with them turns increasingly treacherous. Adapted by Harold Pinter from the novel by Ian McEwan, THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS is a moody, spellbinding study in carefully controlled dread."
"Director Ron Mann dives deep into the history of one of the twentieth century’s most popular yet least respected art forms: the comic book. Profiling twenty-two of North America’s most significant artists working in the medium, this entertaining documentary traces the evolution of comics from the pulp art of the 1930s and ’40s to the underground experimentation of the ’60 and ’70s to the rise of the graphic novel in the ’80s. Jack Kirby, Art Spiegelman, Françoise Mouly, Will Eisner, Frank Miller, Stan Lee, Robert Crumb, Shary Flenniken, and Harvey Pekar are among the giants of the form who read from and speak about their work."

"The brutalized corpse of a Roman prostitute is found along the banks of the Tiber River. The police round up a handful of possible suspects and interrogate them, one by one, each account bringing them closer to the killer. In this, his stunning debut feature, based on a story by Pier Paolo Pasolini, Bernardo Bertolucci utilizes a series of interconnected flashbacks to explore the nature of truth and the reliability of narrative. The Criterion Collection is proud to present the first realization of a legendary talent."
"When a real estate agent is framed for the murders of his wife and her lover, it is up to his faithful secretary (Fanny Ardant) to solve the mystery!"
"Adapted from a novel by Yukio Mishima and told in an intricate flashback structure, CONFLAGRATION dramatizes the psychological collapse of Goichi (Raizo Ichikawa), a young Buddhist acolyte from a dysfunctional family who arrives at a Kyoto temple—the Golden Pavilion—for further study."
"A British documentary, containing several re-enactments, about mankind's centuries-old quest for flight."
"In the summer of 2015, legendary musician David Byrne staged an event at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center to celebrate the creativity of color guard: synchronized dance routines involving flags, rifles, and sabers, colloquially known as “the sport of the arts.” Byrne recruited an array of boundary-pushing performers—including St. Vincent, Nelly Furtado, Devonté Hynes, Nico Muhly, and Ad-Rock—to join him in creating original compositions to accompany ten high school color guard teams’ performances. The result is CONTEMPORARY COLOR, a bold and irrepressible snapshot of a one-of-a-kind live experience that celebrates the visceral thrill of sound joined with movement."
"Interrogating the Selena phenomenon, Lourdes Portillo brings together a group of Chicana cultural critics to talk about the Tejana music icon. Delving into their reactions to Selena’s groundbreaking rise, widespread influence, and tragic death, the conversation goes beyond the singer’s life and legacy to explore questions of representation and the intersection of pop and the personal."
"A mysterious writer of poison-pen letters, known only as Le Corbeau (the Raven), plagues a French provincial town, unwittingly exposing the collective suspicion and rancor seething beneath the community’s calm surface. Made during the Nazi Occupation of France, Henri-Georges Clouzot’s LE CORBEAU was attacked by the right-wing Vichy regime, the left-wing Resistance press, and the Catholic Church, and it was banned after the Liberation. But some—including Jean Cocteau and Jean-Paul Sartre—recognized the powerful subtext to Clouzot’s anti-informant, anti-Gestapo fable, and worked to rehabilitate Clouzot’s directorial reputation after the war. LE CORBEAU brilliantly captures a spirit of paranoid pettiness and self-loathing turning an occupied French town into a twentieth-century Salem."
"Anchored by a stunning performance from newcomer Bartosz Bielenia, this moral tinderbox is an emotionally gripping, darkly humorous portrait of a man on a most curious road to redemption. Following his release from a Warsaw prison for a violent crime, twenty-year-old Daniel (Bielenia) is sent to a remote village to work as a manual laborer. The job is designed to keep the ex-con busy, but Daniel has a higher calling. When one quick lie allows him to be mistaken for the town’s new priest, Daniel sets about leading his newfound flock, inspiring the congregation through his passion and charisma even as he edges toward a dark secret that the community hasn’t revealed in the confessional booth."
"In 1840s London, Dr. Thomas Bolton (Boris Karloff) dares to dream the unthinkable: to operate on patients without causing pain. Unfortunately, the road to general anesthesia is blocked by a ruthless killer (Christopher Lee), as well as Bolton’s devastating addiction to his own chemical experiments."
"Directed by Reema Sengupta • 2018 • India
"
"En garde! Alexandre Dumas’s classic tale of injustice and retribution gets a stirring adaptation in this spirited swashbuckler. Robert Donat stars as officer Edmond Dantes, who is imprisoned on the island fortress of Monte Cristo after he is falsely accused of conspiring with Napoleon. When a dying fellow inmate informs him of a secret treasure, Dantes hatches a cunning plot to use the riches to exact elaborate revenge on those who wronged him. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO vividly captures the adventure, romance, and historical color of Dumas’s immortal novel."
A hotel in Stockholm has vacancies that a cast of characters soon fills. Romance and rumor make their rounds through the building as those living and working under the same roof realize their fondness for each other.
"Latvia, 1919: the end of the Russian Civil War. An aristocratic young woman (brilliantly played by Margarethe von Trotta) becomes involved with a sexually repressed Prussian soldier. When she is rejected by her love, the young woman is sent into a downward spiral of psychosexual depression, promiscuity, and revolutionary collaboration. A startling tale of heartbreak and violence set against the backdrop of bloody revolution, Volker Schlöndorff's COUP DE GRÂCE is a powerful film that explores the interrelation of private passion and political commitment."
"Just before embarking on PARIS BELONGS TO US, Jacques Rivette directed the following 1956 short film about an adulterous wife and her lover’s attempt to figure out how she will explain his gift of a mink coat. Cowritten by fellow French New Wave luminary Claude Chabrol, it features cameos by him and filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut."
"Director Evald Schorm reflects on the changing political tides of his generation in this clear-eyed study of idealism and disillusionment. Jarda (Jan Kačer) is a passionate Communist worker fervently dedicated to the principles of his party. But as those around him grow increasingly disenchanted with the cause, he must confront a sobering realization: could it be that everything he has fought for has been for nothing?"
"Made while Jacques Tati was in production on PlayTime, and shot on the sets built for that film, the twentyty-seven minute Cours du soir was directed by Tati assistant Nicolas Ribowski and stars Tati as an acting instructor."
"In Jean-Charles Tacchella's film, a pair of distant cousins meet at a wedding and the two develop a friendship so deep that their spouses become suspicious."
"In LES COUSINS, Claude Chabrol crafts a sly moral fable about a provincial boy who comes to live with his sophisticated bohemian cousin in Paris. Through these seeming opposites, Chabrol conjures a darkly comic character study that questions notions of good and evil, love and jealousy, and success in the modern world. A mirror image of LE BEAU SERGE, Chabrol’s debut, LES COUSINS recasts that film’s stars, Jean-Claude Brialy and Gérard Blain, in startlingly reversed roles. This dagger-sharp drama won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and was an important early entry in the French New Wave."
Satyajit Ray's 1965 short feature THE COWARD (Kapurush) stars Soumitra Chatterjee as an aspiring screenwriter who encounters a former lover (Madhabi Mukherjee) when his car breaks down near her home.
"Bill Plympton spins a children’s fable about the power of advertising, the meaning of life, and ultimately the test of a mother’s love."
"This landmark film by the virtuosic Mikhail Kalatozov was heralded as a revelation in the post-Stalin Soviet Union and the international cinema community alike. It tells the story of Veronica (Tatiana Samoilova) and Boris (Alexei Batalov), a couple who are blissfully in love until World War II tears them apart. With Boris at the front, Veronica must try to ward off spiritual numbness and defend herself from the increasingly forceful advances of her beau’s draft-dodging cousin. Winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, THE CRANES ARE FLYING is a superbly crafted drama with impassioned performances and viscerally emotional, gravity-defying cinematography by Kalatozov’s regular collaborator Sergei Urusevsky."
"Two brothers compete for the amorous favors of a young woman during a seaside summer of gambling, boating, and drinking, in this seminal Sun Tribe (taiyozoku) film from director Kô Nakahira. Adapted from the controversial novel by Shintarô Ishihara, and critically savaged for its lurid portrayal of the postwar sexual revolution among Japan’s young and privileged, CRAZED FRUIT is an anarchic outcry against tradition and the older generation."
"CREATIVE NONFICTION is director Lena Dunham’s first feature, made in 2009, during her junior and senior years at Oberlin College."
"One of Agnès Varda least-seen films is also one of her most fascinating: an eccentrically imaginative science-fiction fantasia that touches on human nature, free will, and the creative process. Working with major stars for the first time on a feature film, Varda casts Michel Piccoli as a writer and Catherine Deneuve as his silent wife, a couple who relocate to the island of Noirmoutier (a longtime second home for Varda and her husband, Jacques Demy) where strange goings-on hint at a sinister force controlling the minds and actions of the residents. Slipping between “reality” and fiction, genre spectacle and avant-garde experimentation, LES CRÉATURES is a beguiling, endlessly inventive exploration of the mysterious alchemy that transforms life into art."
"Czechoslovak New Wave iconoclast Juraj Herz’s terrifying, darkly comic vision of the horrors of totalitarian ideologies stars a supremely chilling Rudolf Hrušínský as the pathologically morbid Karel Kopfrkingl, a crematorium manager in 1930s Prague who believes fervently that death offers the only true relief from human suffering. When he is recruited by the Nazis, Kopfrkingl’s increasingly deranged worldview drives him to formulate his own shocking final solution. Blending the blackest of gallows humor with disorienting expressionistic flourishes—queasy point-of-view shots, distorting lenses, jarring quick cuts—the controversial, long-banned masterpiece THE CREMATOR is one of cinema’s most trenchant and disturbing portraits of the banality of evil."
"Carlos Saura’s exquisite CRÍA CUERVOS . . . heralded a turning point in Spain: shot while General Franco was on his deathbed, the film melds the personal and the political in a portrait of the legacy of fascism and its effects on a middle-class family (the title derives from the Spanish proverb: “Raise ravens and they'll peck out your eyes” Ana Torrent (the dark-eyed beauty from THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE) portrays the disturbed eight-year-old Ana, living in Madrid with her two sisters and mourning the death of her mother, whom she conjures as a ghost (an ethereal Geraldine Chaplin). Seamlessly shifting between fantasy and reality, the film subtly evokes both the complex feelings of childhood and the struggles of a nation emerging from the shadows."
"This existential wail of a drama concerns two sisters, Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann), keeping vigil for a third, Agnes (Harriet Andersson), who is dying of cancer and can find solace only in the arms of a beatific servant (Kari Sylwan). An intensely felt film that is one of Bergman’s most striking formal experiments, CRIES AND WHISPERS (which won an Oscar for the extraordinary color photography by Sven Nykvist) is a powerful depiction of human behavior in the face of death, positioned on the borders between reality and nightmare, tranquility and terror."
"CRISIS: BEHIND A PRESIDENTIAL COMMITMENT provided filmmaker Robert Drew, his crew and his audience the rare opportunity to watch a President of the United States deal with a national crisis. In this case, the crisis of the title was the attempted integration of the University of Alabama by African-American students by the Kennedy Administration and the machinations of then Governor George Wallace to stop them."
"Three years after his star-making debut in Robert Siodmak’s noir classic THE KILLERS, Burt Lancaster reunited with the director for this twist-laden tale of doomed passion and betrayal. He stars as Steve Thompson, an armored-car driver who walks into danger when he resumes his affair with his ex-wife (Yvonne De Carlo) while simultaneously hatching a plan to rob his company with her new mobster husband (Dan Duryea). Siodmak’s baroque visual style and command of atmosphere heighten the expressionistic intensity of one of the most bleakly fatalistic noirs ever made."
"This film was Hollis Frampton’s first attempt at both working with actors and using sync sound. The performers, two students from the State University of New York at Binghamton, were given an outline of a situation from which to improvise."
"A woman’s nightly domestic rituals—from putting her baby to bed to making love—unspool in a playful parade of surreal, straight-from-the-id images."
"Guillermo del Toro made an auspicious and audacious feature debut with CRONOS, a highly unorthodox tale about the seductiveness of the idea of immortality. Kindly antiques dealer Jesús Gris (Federico Luppi) happens upon an ancient golden device in the shape of a scarab, and soon finds himself the possessor and victim of its sinister, addictive powers, as well as the target of a mysterious American named Angel (a delightfully crude and deranged Ron Perlman). Featuring marvelous special makeup effects and the haunting imagery for which del Toro has become world-renowned, CRONOS is a dark, visually rich, and emotionally captivating fantasy."
"Director Howard Hawks brings a dynamic punch to this high-speed thrill ride set in the world of race-car driving. The fastest man on four wheels, Indy champ Joe Greer (James Cagney) has strong ideas when it comes to flashy women and his kid brother, Eddie (Eric Linden). So when the two come to blows over Eddie’s refusal to give his brassy girlfriend (Joan Blondell) the air, Joe is driven to drink, resulting in a car crash that destroys his nerve and threatens to wreck his career. Shot on location at the Ventura Raceway and the Indianapolis and Ascot Motor speedways, THE CROWD ROARS features appearances by eight pro racers, including 1930 Indy winner Billy Arnold, and some of the wildest racing sequences ever to burn up the screen."
"Fresh out of the slammer, Togawa (Branded to Kill's rough-and-ready Joe Shishido) has no chance to go straight because he is immediately coerced by a wealthy mob boss into organizing a heist on an armored car carrying racetrack receipts. After assembling a ragtag bunch to carry out the robbery, Togawa learns that all is not what it seems in Takumi Furukawa's thriller. Cue the double (and triple) crosses!"
"In 1960's Japan, a couple extorts money from sexually aggressive men."
"The first of only two films directed by trailblazing independent filmmaker Kathleen Collins is a luminous adaptation of a series of Henry H. Roth short stories about the relationship that develops between an elderly Irish woman and three orphaned Puerto Rican brothers who help to restore her once-grand Hudson Valley home and whose lives are watched over by their father’s ghost. With its expressive cinematography and magical-realist flourishes, THE CRUZ BROTHERS AND MISS MALLOY is both a charming celebration of Nuyorican culture and a unique exploration of how the shadows of a family’s past can loom over the present."
"A different person has confessed to each of the serial killings in which an X has been cut into the throats of the victims, but none of them can explain their motives. Detective Takabe finds no clues to the connection between them until he encounters a strange young man..."
An artist falls for an art model who reminds him of a sculpture.
An affecting tale of personal tragedy is told entirely through close-ups of a construction worker’s hands.
"Spending most of her days at home following the birth of her son but curious as ever about the people and places that surrounded her, Agnès Varda found inspiration for DAGUERRÉOTYPES just outside her door: on Paris’s rue Daguerre, where she had lived and worked since the 1950s. The director turns her camera on the business owners whose shops are the street’s lifeblood: bakers, tailors, butchers, perfumers, music-store clerks, driving instructors, and others, who, between the everyday rituals of their work, talk of their lives, relationships, and dreams. Blending her photographer’s eye for still portraiture with her filmmaker’s gift for finding visual rhymes and resonances between images, Varda reveals the rich social fabric of an entire world—all without leaving her block."
"A successful Japanese movie director in his 60s becomes increasingly ill while working on his latest film. His family, friends, and doctor try to keep the secret of his terminal cancer from him, but it gradually becomes clear. Coming to terms with his own mortality is painful, and involves some major conflicts with his wife and the hospital staff. But having done so, he realizes he doesn't want to die in the hospital on a life support machine. He manages to finish his final film, and, enjoying the last days of his life as never before, he dies at home surrounded by all the people he cares about."
"Maybe the New Wave's most anarchic entry, Vera Chytilovà's absurdist farce follows the misadventures of two brash young women. Believing the world to be ""spoiled,"" they embark on a series of pranks in which nothing, food, clothes, men, war, is taken seriously. DAISIES is an aesthetically and politically adventurous film that's widely considered one of the great works of feminist cinema."
"The avant-garde imagination of legendary choreographer Busby Berkeley runs riot in this fizzy backstage musical. Joan Blondell and Ruby Keeler are the chorus girls who use their wits to trick a moral-minded, anti-Broadway millionaire (Hugh Herbert) and his hapless brother-in-law (Guy Kibbee) into financing their new musical, giving Berkeley pretext to unleash one of his wildest kaleidoscopic creations: a showstopping number set to “I Only Have Eyes for You” featuring dozens of floating cutouts of Keeler’s face."
"This unique love story, based on a novelette by Denis Diderot and with dialogue written by Jean Cocteau, follows the maneuverings of a society lady as she connives to initiate a scandalous affair between her aristocratic ex-lover and a prostitute. With his second feature film, director Robert Bresson was already forging his singularly brilliant filmmaking technique as he created a moving study of the power of revenge and the strength of true love."
"One of the great artistic forces of the twentieth century, performer, choreographer, and teacher Martha Graham influenced dance worldwide. Criterion presents a sampling of her stunning craft, all collaborations with television arts-programming pioneer Nathan Kroll. A DANCER’S WORLD (1957), narrated by Graham herself, is a glimpse into her class work and methodology."
The plans of a trio of burglars are continually thwarted by the arrival of visitors to the house they plan to rob. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"Gérard Depardieu and Wojciech Pszoniak star in Andrzej Wajda’s powerful, intimate depiction of the ideological clash between the earthy, man-of-the-people Georges Danton and icy Jacobin extremist Maximilien Robespierre, both key figures of the French Revolution. By drawing parallels to Polish “solidarity,” a movement that was being quashed by the government as the film went into production, Wajda drags history into the present. Meticulous and fiery, DANTON has been hailed as one of the greatest films ever made about the Terror."
"From 1927 to 1928, Jean Painlevé made his first three films aimed at the general public. Shown in ‘ciné-clubs’ and avant-garde movie theaters of Paris, these films were written and edited to entertain as well as educate. DAPHNIA, one of these educational films, is presented here in its original silent version. (Presented without score.)"
"As a filmmaker, Oscar Micheaux was something of a firebrand, but his attitudes and methods were anything but predictable—often leveling criticism at certain strata of the African American community. His most outrageous film is a traditional minstrel show—an olio of broad comedy and choral interludes. It is an acknowledgement of minstrelsy as a defining tradition of African American stage performance (see also the blackface routines in Micheaux’s TEN MINUTES TO LIVE). If nothing else, THE DARKTOWN REVUE is an invaluable historical document for recording on film the “Hard Shell Sermon” routine popularized by turn-of-the-century minstrel performer Amon Davis. But there is something else. True to form, Micheaux’s depiction of a minister is not flattering. Davis’s comic sermon of gibberish is a scathing satire of charismatic religion, made even more troubling by the fact that it is performed by a black man in blackface. By the same token, one cannot help but wonder if Micheaux was further provoking his audience by having the uplifting Donald Heywood choir open the film with a rendition of “Watermelon Time.”"

"The first sound film by Julien Duvivier also marked his first collaboration with the marvelous actor Harry Baur. Together, they brought to life the vivid protagonist of Irène Némirovsky's best-selling first novel, an avaricious, self-interested banker whose family life is as tempestuous as his business dealings. Directed with visual panache, this grim yet arresting tale showcases Duvivier's preternatural cinematic maturity during a transitional phase for the French film industry."
"A rare glimpse into the mind of one of cinema’s most enigmatic visionaries, DAVID LYNCH: THE ART LIFE offers an absorbing portrait of the artist, as well as an intimate encounter with the man himself. From his secluded home and painting studio in the Hollywood Hills, a candid Lynch conjures people and places from his past, from his boyhood to his experiences at art school to the beginnings of his filmmaking career—in stories that unfold like scenes from his movies. This remarkable documentary by Jon Nguyen, Rick Barnes, and Olivia Neergaard-Holm travels back to Lynch’s early years as a painter and director drawn to the phantasmagoric, while also illuminating his enduring commitment to what he calls “the art life”: “You drink coffee, you smoke cigarettes, and you paint, and that’s it.”"
"Shot in 1953, though not completed until 1957, Daybreak Express was the first film D. A. Pennebaker made, a mad rush of images of New York City captured from a train and edited to the rhythm of Duke Ellington's song of the same name. A jazz aficionado, Pennebaker thought his career would continue along this path, making short films cut to songs."
"This bittersweet film from Jean Renoir, based on a story by Guy de Maupassant, is a tenderly comic idyll about a city family’s picnic in the French countryside and the romancing of the mother and grown daughter by two local men. Conceived as a short feature, the project had nearly finished production in 1936 when Renoir was called away for THE LOWER DEPTHS. Shooting was abandoned then, but the film was completed with the existing footage by Renoir’s team and released in its current form in 1946, after the director had already moved on to Hollywood. The result is a warmly humanist vignette that ranks among Renoir’s most lyrical works, with a love for nature imbuing its every beautiful frame."
"Filmed during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, Carl Dreyer’s DAY OF WRATH (VREDENS DAG) is a harrowing account of individual helplessness in the face of growing social repression and paranoia. Anna, the young second wife of a well-respected but much older pastor, falls in love with her stepson when he returns to their small seventeenth-century village. Stepping outside the bounds of the village’s harsh moral code has disastrous results. Exquisitely photographed and passionately acted, DAY OF WRATH remains an intense, unforgettable experience."
Charlie Chaplin stars in this comedy short about a middle class family man who encounters one difficulty after another while attempting to make a simple excursion by car and boat with his wife and kids.
"With its droll humor and bittersweet emotional heft, the feature debut of writer-director Greg Mottola announced the arrival of an unassumingly sharp-witted new talent on the 1990s indie film scene. When she discovers a love letter written to her husband (Stanley Tucci) by an unknown paramour, the distraught Eliza (Hope Davis) turns to her tight-knit Long Island family for advice. Soon the entire clan—strong-willed mom (Anne Meara), taciturn dad (Pat McNamara), and jaded sister (Parker Posey) with pretentious boyfriend (Liev Schreiber) in tow—has squeezed into a station wagon and headed into Manhattan to find out the truth, kicking off a one-crazy-day odyssey full of unexpected detours and life-changing revelations. Performed with deadpan virtuosity by a top-flight ensemble cast, THE DAYTRIPPERS is a wry and piercing look at family bonds stretched to the breaking point."
"Directed by character actor Clu Gulager and shot in beautifully burnished tones by the great László Kovács, this experimental short is a dreamily impressionistic, subtly sinister immersion into the imaginative world of a band of boys at play on a sunbaked summer’s day."
"With DEAD MAN, his first period piece, Jim Jarmusch imagined the nineteenth-century American West as an existential wasteland, delivering a surreal reckoning with the ravages of industrialization, the country's legacy of violence and prejudice, and the natural cycle of life and death. Accountant William Blake (Johnny Depp) has hardly arrived in the godforsaken outpost of Machine before he's caught in the middle of a fatal lovers' quarrel. Wounded and on the lam, Blake falls under the watch of the outcast Nobody (Gary Farmer), who guides his companion on a spiritual journey, teaching him to dispense poetic justice along the way. Featuring austerely beautiful black-and-white photography by Robby Müller and a live-wire score by Neil Young, DEAD MAN is a profound and unique revision of the western genre."
"Directed in 1995 by Tammy Rae Carland, this film depicts a young queer woman—played by the filmmaker—rehearsing coming out to her mother."
"Genius provocateur Nagisa Oshima, an influential figure in the Japanese New Wave of the 1960s, made one of his most startling political statements with the compelling pitch-black satire DEATH BY HANGING. In this macabre farce, a Korean man is sentenced to death in Japan but survives his execution, sending the authorities into a panic about what to do next. At once disturbing and oddly amusing, Oshima’s constantly surprising film is a subversive and surreal indictment of both capital punishment and the treatment of Korean immigrants in his country."
"Harry Sanders (Richard Todd), a British policeman, investigates a murder in an African hospital."
"Upper-class geometry professor Juan and his wealthy, married mistress, Maria José, driving back from a late-night rendezvous, accidentally hit a cyclist, and run. The resulting, exquisitely shot tale of guilt, infidelity, and blackmail reveals the wide gap between the rich and the poor in Spain, and surveys the corrupt ethics of a society seduced by decadence. Juan Antonio Bardem’s charged melodrama DEATH OF A CYCLIST (MUERTE DE UN CICLISTA) was a direct attack on 1950s Spanish society under Franco’s rule. Though it was affected by the dictates of censorship, its sting could never be dulled."
"Dustin Hoffman delivers a bravura performance in Volker Schlöndorff’s sterling adaptation of Arthur Miller’s classic drama about the limitations of the American dream. During the postwar boom of the late 1940s, Willy Loman (Hoffman) is an aging traveling salesman who despairs that his life has been lived in vain. Facing dispensability and insignificance in an increasingly youth-driven economy, Willy is not ready to part with his cherished fantasies of an America that admires him for triumphs in the marketplace. But the reality is far more complex than that, as the measure of Willy’s self-delusion and contradictions is revealed through his increasingly strained relationships with his two sons, Biff (John Malkovich) and Harold (Stephen Lang), each grappling with his own understanding of what it means to be a “success.”"
Two Thai sound technicians go to elaborate lengths to get the perfect audio for an upcoming film—but is anybody listening?
"After their executions are faked by the authorities, three criminals are forced to become assassins under the command of the Shogun."
"In this alternately macabre and mirthful thriller, based on a true-crime story, renowned Mexican director Arturo Ripstein brings a stylish audacity to the tale of the ""Lonely Hearts Killers,"" a couple who, in the 1940s, posed as brother and sister to lure and murder unsuspecting widows. Featuring performances both sympathetic and stomach-churning by Regina Orozco and Daniel Giménez Cacho, Deep Crimson (Profundo carmesí) is a wild update of the same events that inspired Leonard Kastle's The Honeymoon Killers."
"Adapted from the best seller by JAWS author Peter Benchley, this action-packed blockbuster thriller gave audiences yet another reason to stay out of the water. Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset are the vacationing Americans who discover a sunken World War II munitions ship while scuba diving off the coast of Bermuda. Among the relics, they find a cache of drugs, a discovery that quickly embroils them in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with the gangsters who stashed it. Robert Shaw, who played the shark hunter Quint in JAWS, costars, while Donna Summer sings the sultry title song written by James Bond composer John Barry."
"DEER BOY is a story about a hunter's son, who was born with antlers, and about how each man kills the thing he loves."
"Writer-director Albert Brooks stars opposite Meryl Streep in this delightfully offbeat romantic comedy that shows it’s never too late to change your life—even if you’re already dead. When advertising executive Daniel Miller (Brooks) dies suddenly in a car accident, he’s transported to Judgment City and faces a tribunal to decide whether he will go to a better place or return to earth for another incarnation. It doesn’t look good for Miller, but unexpectedly and for the first time in his life—and past lives—Miller discovers love. With his fourth feature, Brooks added a touch of warmth to his prickly comic style, and the result is one of his most touching and thought-provoking films."
"Directed by Jacques Tati's daughter Sophie Tatischeff, Dégustation maison is a thirteen-minute comic short shot in a café in Sainte-Sévère-sur-Indre, the same town where Tati's Jour de fěte was filmed. It won the Cesar Award for best short fiction film in 1978."
"When Sokichi's abandoned mistress shows up on his doorstep with their three children, she is as surprised to discover he has a wife as his wife is to discover that he has a mistress."
"In making Deprisa, Deprisa, director Carlos Saura populated his cast with actual denizens of the Madrid streets to tell the story of youth on the edge of doom -- and the movie was good enough to win the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival."
The Russian army sends an explorer on an expedition to the snowy Siberian wilderness where he makes friends with a seasoned local hunter.
"Donna Deitch's swooning and sensual first narrative feature, DESERT HEARTS, was groundbreaking upon its release in 1985: a love story about two women, made entirely independently, on a shoestring budget, by a woman. In this 1959-set film, adapted from a beloved novel by Jane Rule, straitlaced East Coast professor Vivian Bell (Helen Shaver) arrives in Reno to file for divorce but winds up catching the eye of someone new, the free-spirited young Cay (Patricia Charbonneau), touching off a slow seduction that unfolds against a breathtaking desert landscape. With undeniable chemistry between its two leads, an evocative jukebox soundtrack, and vivid cinematography by Robert Elswit, DESERT HEARTS beautifully exudes a sense of tender yearning and emotional candor."
"Sacha Guitry exchanges his usual top hat for a uniform in Désiré, playing a cavalier valet embroiled in an awkward flirtation with his new employer (played by the actor-director's real-life wife, Jacqueline Delubac), who is involved with a stuffy politician. A carefree class farce filled with memorable supporting characters, Désiré blurs the distinction between upstairs and downstairs."
"The original Godzilla team of director Ishiro Honda, special-effects supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya, and composer Akira Ifukube reunited for this kaiju extravaganza, which features no fewer than eleven monsters. Set in the remote future of 1999, when the people of Earth have achieved world peace by confining destructive creatures to Monsterland (until an alien race intervenes), DESTROY ALL MONSTERS mounts a thrilling display of innovative action sequences and memorable images that have made it a favorite for generations of viewers."
"From Poverty Row came a movie that, perhaps more than any other, epitomizes the dark fatalism at the heart of film noir. As he hitchhikes his way from New York to Los Angeles, a down-on-his-luck nightclub pianist (Tom Neal) finds himself with a dead body on his hands and nowhere to run—a waking nightmare that goes from bad to worse when he picks up the most vicious femme fatale in cinema history, Ann Savage’s snarling, monstrously conniving drifter Vera. Working with no-name stars on a bargain-basement budget, B auteur Edgar G. Ulmer turned threadbare production values and seedy, low-rent atmosphere into indelible pulp poetry. Long unavailable in a format in which its hard-boiled beauty could be fully appreciated, DETOUR haunts anew in its first major restoration."
"With his customary restraint and ruthless attention to detail, director Jean-Pierre Melville follows the parallel tracks of French underworld criminal Gu (the inimitable Lino Ventura), escaped from prison and roped into one last robbery, and the suave inspector, Blot, relentlessly seeking him. The implosive LE DEUXIEME SOUFFLE captures the pathos, loneliness, and excitement of a life in the shadows with methodical suspense and harrowing authenticity."
"A young woman's father-in-law begins to believe that she is a reincarnation of the goddess Kali, to whom he is strongly devoted. As she falls under the adoring eyes of other villagers, she begins to lose herself to the illusion in this tragic fable directed by Satyajit Ray."
"Jabez Stone is a hard-working farmer trying to make an honest living, but a streak of bad luck tempts him to do the unthinkable: bargain with the Devil himself. For seven years of good fortune, Stone promises “Mr. Scratch” his soul when the contract ends. When the troubled farmer begins to realize the error of his choice, he enlists the aid of the one man who might save him: the legendary orator and politician Daniel Webster. Directed with stylish flair by William Dieterle, THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER brings the classic short story by Stephen Vincent Benét to life with inspired visuals, an unforgettable Oscar-winning score by Bernard Herrmann, and a truly diabolical performance from Walter Huston."
"Directed in shadow-etched, expressionist style by Anthony Mann, this groundbreaking revisionist western was one of the first Hollywood films to portray Native Americans with empathy and complexity, despite its casting of a white lead in a Native role. Shoshone tribesman and Civil War hero Lance Poole (Robert Taylor) returns home with a Congressional Medal of Honor on his chest and a saddlebag full of dreams about prospering as a cattleman on his family’s land. Instead, he finds the white Americans he fought for scheming to take over his property. When the legal system proves unjust, Poole vows to defend his people—even if it means a return to violence."
"Ingmar Bergman's 1960 fantasy-comedy follows a reincarnated Don Juan on his assignment from the Devil, to seduce a country parson's young daughter, tarnishing her purity and shattering her faith in love. But his evil aims are muddled as the charming girl causes him to question his own beliefs."
"Fred Schepisi’s celebrated first feature is a lushly photographed period drama detailing a young boy’s coming of age in a strict Catholic seminary in 1950s Victoria. A semiautobiographical retelling of the director’s own training for the priesthood, THE DEVIL’S PLAYGROUND follows thirteen-year-old Tom Allen (Simon Burke), a serious-minded boy whose calling for the church is complicated by guilt associated with his awakening sexuality and “sinful” thoughts. While the ascetic Brother Francine (Arthur Dignam) prowls the school’s corridors looking for evidence of “the undisciplined mind,” the hard-drinking Brother Victor (Nick Tate) pushes back against the harsh discipline that scars the hearts and minds of the students as each battles a desire to consummate the pleasures of the flesh."
"With this Palme d’Or–winning drama, which deftly combines seemingly disparate genres, French filmmaker Jacques Audiard cemented his status as a titan of contemporary world cinema. In an arresting performance, the nonprofessional actor Antonythasan Jesuthasan (himself a former child soldier) stars as a Tamil fighter who, along with a woman and a child posing as his wife and daughter, flees war-torn Sri Lanka only to land in a Paris suburb blighted by drugs. As the makeshift family embarks on a new life, DHEEPAN settles into an intimate social-realist mode before tightening into a dynamic turf-war thriller, as well as an unsettling study of the psychological aftereffects of combat. Searing and sensitive, Audiard’s film is a unique depiction of the refugee experience as a continuous crisis of identity."
"Before PSYCHO, PEEPING TOM, and REPULSION, there was DIABOLIQUE. This thriller from Henri-Georges Clouzot, which shocked audiences in Europe and the U.S., is the story of two women, the fragile wife and the willful mistress of the sadistic headmaster of a boys’ boarding school, who hatch a daring revenge plot. With its unprecedented narrative twists and terrifying images, DIABOLIQUE is a heart-grabbing benchmark in horror filmmaking, featuring outstanding performances by Simone Signoret, Véra Clouzot, and Paul Meurisse."
"When bighearted but dim-witted Portuguese soccer hunk Diamantino (Carloto Cotta) blows it in the World Cup finals, he goes from superstar to laughing stock overnight. His sheltered worldview is further shattered after learning about the European refugee crisis, and he resolves to make amends by adopting an African refugee—only to find that his new “son” is actually an undercover lesbian tax auditor investigating him on the suspicion of corruption. From there, Diamantino gets swept up in a gonzo comic odyssey involving cigarette-smoking evil twins, Secret Service skullduggery, mad-science genetic modification, and a right-wing anti-EU conspiracy. Vividly photographed in Super 16 mm and featuring the biggest stampedes of giant Pekingese puppies you’ve ever seen, Gabriel Abrantes and Daniel Schmidt’s genre-blending and gender-bending satire is a high-camp masterpiece."
"With this simultaneously harrowing and lyrical debut feature, Jan Němec established himself as the most uncompromising visionary among the radical filmmakers who made up the Czechoslovak New Wave. Adapted from a novel by Arnošt Lustig, DIAMONDS OF THE NIGHT closely tracks two boys who escape from a concentration-camp transport and flee into the surrounding woods, hostile terrain where the brute realities of survival coexist with dreams, memories, and fragments of visual poetry. Along with visceral camera work by Jaroslav Kučera and Miroslav Ondříček—two of Czechoslovak cinema’s most influential cinematographers—Němec makes inventive use of fractured editing, elliptical storytelling, and flights of surrealism as he strips context away from this bare-bones tale, evoking the panicked delirium of consciousness lost in night and fog."
"When a thief is caught stealing form a book shop by one of its employees, the two embark on an unusual, erotic adventure."
"Director Nagisa Oshima investigates Japanese-Korean relations in DEATH BY HANGING, a subject he earlier explored in this experimental 1965 documentary, the heartrending portrait of an impoverished South Korean boy."
Diatoms are explored through microscopic footage while their purpose and uses are explained.
"In this magnificently inscrutable late-sixties masterpiece, Marco Ferreri, one of European cinema’s most idiosyncratic auteurs, takes us through the looking glass to one seemingly routine night in the life of an Italian gas mask designer, played, in a tour de force performance, by New Wave icon Michel Piccoli. In his claustrophobic mod home, he pampers his pill-popping wife, seduces his maid, and uncovers a gun that may have once been owned by John Dillinger—and then things get even stranger. A surreal political missive about social malaise, DILLINGER IS DEAD (DILLINGER È MORTO) finds absurdity in the mundane. It is a singular experience, both illogical and grandly existential."
"As the Allies march toward Paris in the summer of 1944, Hitler gives orders that the French capital should not fall into enemy hands, or if it does, then “only as a field of rubble.” The person assigned to carry out this barbaric act is General Dietrich von Choltitz (Niels Arestrup), who already has mines planted on the Eiffel Tower, in the Louvre and Notre Dame, and on the bridges over the Seine. Nothing should be left as a reminder of the city’s former glory. However, at dawn on August 25, Swedish Consul General Raoul Nordling (André Dussollier) steals into German headquarters through a secret underground tunnel and there starts a tension-filled game of cat and mouse as Nordling tries to persuade Choltitz to abandon his plan."
"A lonely security guard—tasked with overseeing a building that houses the infrastructure of the internet—finds herself drawn into a digital dating vortex in this sinister, surrealist tale of love in the age of AI."
"In an unauthorized retelling of W. Somerset Maugham’s short story “Miss Thompson,” Francine Everette stars as Gertie La Rue, a nightclub entertainer who arrives at a Caribbean resort to entertain the tourists and the GIs stationed nearby. But an intolerant reformer (Alfred Hawkins) condemns Gertie’s sultry brand of entertainment and vows to chase her back to Harlem. With DIRTY GERTIE FROM HARLEM U.S.A. (1946), the African American independent film emerges from the domain of self-financed, low-tech movies made for a limited audience and begins to cross over into the mainstream. It is less like the rough-around-the-edges work of Oscar Micheaux and more akin to the Hollywood black-cast films, such as GREEN PASTURES and STORMY WEATHER, intended for audiences of all races."
"For a French television series about grandmothers, Chantal Akerman interviews elderly women who survived the Shoah, including her own mother, whose experience in the Holocaust reverberated throughout the artist’s life and work."
Agnès Varda turns her camera on the sculpted female figures that grace the architecture of Paris.
"Baron Ferdinando Cefalù (Marcello Mastroianni) longs to marry his nubile young cousin Angela (Stefania Sandrelli), but one obstacle stands in his way: his fatuous and fawning wife, Rosalia (Daniela Rocca). His solution? Since divorce is illegal, he hatches a plan to lure his spouse into the arms of another and then murder her in a justifiable effort to save his honor. The Criterion Collection is proud to present director Pietro Germi’s hilarious and cutting satire of Sicilian male-chauvinist culture, winner of the 1962 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay."
"Droll comedy of manners and morals that was based on a play and made as a film once before in 1932 as COUNSEL'S OPINION, directed by Allan Dwan. The four screenwriters' literate script of Biro's adaptation of the stage work takes Oberon to a London hotel where she is attending a costume party. The weather turns foul and she must spend the night at the hostelry with several other ladies who were unable to make it home. Olivier is a young lawyer occupying a suite and the manager prevails on him to give up some of the space in his copious quarters, but Olivier is adamant until Oberon uses her wiles on him. The result is that she gets the comfortable bed and Olivier must snooze on the floor in the next room. In the morning, she leaves before he can find out anything about this fascinating and attractive woman. Her alacrity causes him to wonder if she's married. When he arrives at his office, an old school chum contacts him and wants Olivier to handle his divorce. The man is sure his wife spent the night with another man at the same hotel we've seen earlier. Olivier can't believe this nerd could be married to Oberon. He isn't, of course, and his wife is someone else entirely. But Olivier doesn't know that yet. So it gets down to one of those British drawing-room farces where identities are mistaken, accusations are made, absurd situations occur, and Olivier and Oberon are together at the finale. Richardson is very funny as the man who wants a divorce from wife Barnes, who has been married thrice before and has backhanded fidelity on many other occasions. Oberon shows she can play light comedy as well as some of the heavier work she had to do over the years. The Technicolor tinting was supervised by long-time advisor Natalie Kalmus and, although it lent a nice air to the already-airy material, it was totally unnecessary."
"This visual animated poem travels between desperation and dark comedy. EL DOCTOR takes place in a crumbling Mexican hospital at the turn of the century. Inhabited by surreal characters—including a man shot with one hundred holes, a girl who has sprouted morning glories, and a woman who thinks she is a horse—the hospital is tended by a doctor who prefers to drink. The Saint of Holes and a mysterious gargoyle rearrange the Doctor’s fated demise and send him on a journey of altered perspective. More than five years in the making, the film was entirely hand painted by a small group of artists in Los Angeles and Mexico. The screenplay was written by Blue Kraning, and the voices for the film were recorded by nonprofessionals in Morelia, Mexico."
"This small-scale fiction about a divorced mother and her child (played by Agnès Varda's own son) leading a quiet existence on L.A.'s margins was made directly after Mur Murs, and though DOCUMENTEUR is different in form and tone from that film, the two are complexly interwoven, with overlapping images and ideas. This meditative portrait of urban isolation overflows with subtle visual poetry."
"By turns tragic and transcendent, Akira Kurosawa’s film follows the daily lives of a group of people barely scraping by in a slum on the outskirts of Tokyo. Yet as desperate as their circumstances are, each of them—the homeless father and son envisioning their dream house; the young woman abused by her uncle; the boy who imagines himself a trolley conductor—finds reasons to carry on. The unforgettable DODES’KA-DEN was made at a tumultuous moment in Kurosawa’s life. And all of his hopes, fears, and artistic passion are on fervent display in this, his gloriously shot first color film."
A young woman gets a jarring introduction to the brutal reality of toxic masculinity in this at once lyrical and hard-hitting vision of the end of innocence. 
"Charlie Chaplin’s first film for First National Films, A DOG’S LIFE revolves around Chaplin’s iconic Tramp character as he navigates the cityscape with ‘Scraps’ the dog. The two go on a journey to help the Tramp have a better life with Edna, a dance hall singer and the Tramp’s love interest."
"Enigmatic, darkly hilarious, and totally unforgettable, Yorgos Lanthimos’s Oscar-nominated international sensation announced his arrival as one of contemporary cinema’s most audacious voices and brought the so-called Greek Weird Wave to worldwide attention. In an effort to protect their three children from the corrupting influence of the outside world, a couple transforms their home into a gated compound of cultural deprivation and strict rules of behavior. But children cannot remain innocent forever. When the father brings home a young woman to satisfy his son’s sexual urges, the family’s engineered reality gradually starts to crumble. Spiked with moments of shocking violence and outré comedy, DOGTOOTH is a biting social satire that is as profound as it is provocative."
"Money can't buy you happiness, but a lack of money can certainly bring you unhappiness, as a group of friends and their wives discover. The almighty dollar tests all of the relationships in this Swedish comedy."
"For what was to become her last feature, Brigitte Bardot teamed up once again with the man who made her famous, Roger Vadim. Bardot plays Jeanne, a proud destroyer of men who lives on board an ultra-mod submarine. As Jeanne confesses her sexual conquests to a priest, one can't help but see Bardot as the sex symbol whose public persona was so often synonymous with the characters she portrayed."
"In this lovingly crafted, wildly eccentric adaptation of a classic French fairy tale, Jacques Demy casts Catherine Deneuve as a princess who must go into hiding as a scullery maid in order to fend off an unwanted marriage proposal—from her own father, the king (Jean Marais). A topsy-turvy riches-to-rags fable with songs by Michel Legrand, DONKEY SKIN creates a tactile fantasy world that’s perched on the border between the earnest and the satiric, and features Delphine Seyrig in a delicious supporting role as a fashionable fairy godmother."
"“Mr. And Mrs. Donald Henderson request your presence at a little get-together.” When you mix a left-wing teacher, a loudmouthed sex maniac, a mild-mannered accountant, a failed philosopher, a promiscuous teenager, a frustrated wife, a drunken pornographer, a temperamental artist, and an arrogant dentist with a lot of booze together on the night of the 1969 Australian federal election anything can—and will—happen at a raucous shindig to remember. Adapted by David Williamson from his own hit stage play and featuring an A-list cast of Aussie greats, DON’S PARTY is a button-pushing, cunningly incisive snapshot of a country at a decisive sociopolitical moment that plays like an Australian New Wave answer to SHAMPOO."
"Bob Dylan is captured on-screen as he never would be again in this groundbreaking film from D. A. Pennebaker. The legendary documentarian finds Dylan in England during his 1965 tour, which would be his last as an acoustic artist. In this wildly entertaining vision of one of the twentieth century’s greatest artists, Dylan is surrounded by teen fans, gets into heated philosophical jousts with journalists, and kicks back with fellow musicians Joan Baez, Donovan, and Alan Price. Featuring some of Dylan’s most famous songs, including “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” “The Times They Are A-Changin’,” and “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” DONT LOOK BACK is a radically conceived portrait of an American icon that has influenced decades of vérité behind-the-scenes documentaries."
"While attending University College London, writer-director Christopher Nolan made a series of short films, including DOODLEBUG (1997)."
"Krzysztof Kieślowski’s international breakthrough remains one of his most beloved films, a ravishing, mysterious rumination on identity, love, and human intuition. Irène Jacob is incandescent as both Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, Véronique, a French music teacher. Though unknown to each other, the two women share an enigmatic, emotional bond, which Kieślowski details in gorgeous reflections, colors, and movements. Aided by Slawomir Idziak’s shimmering cinematography and Zbigniew Preisner’s haunting, operatic score, Kieślowski creates one of cinema's most purely metaphysical works. THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VÉRONIQUE is an unforgettable symphony of feeling."
"Many films have drawn from classic Japanese theatrical forms, but none with such shocking cinematic effect as director Masahiro Shinoda’s DOUBLE SUICIDE. In this striking adaptation of a Bunraku puppet play (featuring the music of famed composer Toru Takemitsu), a paper merchant sacrifices family, fortune, and ultimately life for his erotic obsession with a prostitute. "
"A complex web of infatuation, deceit and miscommunication wreaks havoc on the many members of an aristocratic estate."
"Director Jim Jarmusch followed up his brilliant breakout film STRANGER THAN PARADISE with another, equally beloved portrait of loners and misfits in the American landscape. When fate brings together three hapless men—an unemployed disc jockey (Tom Waits), a small-time pimp (John Lurie), and a strong-willed Italian tourist (Roberto Benigni)—in a Louisiana prison, a singular adventure ensues. Described by Jarmusch as a “neo-Beat noir comedy,” DOWN BY LAW is part nightmare and part fairy tale, featuring sterling performances and crisp black-and-white cinematography by the esteemed Robby Müller."
"In this silent British drama directed by Alfred Hitchcock, two boarding school boys get involved with a waitress and face an unfortunate circumstance."
"Made during Chantal Akerman’s time in Israel, this searching self-portrait was shot almost entirely within the confines of her apartment in Tel Aviv. There, she ruminates on her family, Jewish identity, and childhood. She wonders whether “normal,” everyday life is possible in such a place and what it means to make a film there. Most of all, she does not film with any preconceived intentions, expressing her desire to remain as blank and open as possible and to let the process take its own course—a radical objective in a country where seemingly nothing is neutral."
"This formally accomplished and psychologically complex gangster tale pivots on the growing attraction between Joji, a hardened career criminal, and Kazuko, the sweet-natured older sister of a newly initiated young hoodlum, a relationship that provokes the jealousy of Joji's otherwise patient moll, Tokiko. With effortlessly cool performances and visual inventiveness, DRAGNET GIRL is a bravura work from Yasujiro Ozu."
"The art of martial-arts filmmaking took a leap into bold new territory with this action-packed tale of Ming-dynasty intrigue. After having the emperor’s minister of defense executed, a power-grabbing eunuch sends assassins to trail the victim’s children to a remote point on the northern Chinese border. But that bloodthirsty mission is confounded by a mysterious group of fighters who arrive on the scene, intent on delivering justice and defending the innocent. The first film King Hu made after moving to Taiwan from Hong Kong in search of more creative freedom, DRAGON INN (LONG MEN KEZHAN) combines rhythmic editing, meticulous choreography, and gorgeous widescreen compositions with a refinement that was new to the wuxia genre. Its blockbuster success breathed new life into a classic formula and established Hu as one of Chinese cinema’s most audacious innovators."
"Grave and witty by turns, DREAMS develops into a probing study of the psychology of desire. Susanne (Eva Dahlbeck), head of a modeling agency, takes her protégée Doris (Harriet Andersson) to a fashion show in Göteborg, where Susanne makes contact with a former lover, and Doris finds herself pursued by a married dignitary (Gunnar Björnstrand). With its parallel narratives and subtle compositions, this film marked a transition between Ingmar Bergman’s early explorations of affairs of the heart and the more somber and virtuosic masterpieces to come later in the fifties."
"Harold Lloyd plays well-liked, common-sense country doctor Jack Jackson, who cares for the incurable Sick-Little-Well-Girl (Mildred Davis) and takes on the fraudulent Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg (Eric Mayne) in this upbeat silent comedy directed by Fred C. Newmeyer."
"Zoltán Korda's charged adaptation of a novel by The Four Feathers author A. E. W. Mason features Sabu in his second film role, as the teenage Prince Azim, forced into hiding when his father, the ruler of a peaceful kingdom in northwest India, is assassinated by his own ruthless brother. Protected by a friendly British officer (Roger Livesey) and his wife (Valerie Hobson), and befriended by the regiment's drummer boy, Prince Azim ends up fighting with the colonialists against his dastardly uncle. This rousing adventure includes an exuberant performance by Sabu and spectacular Technicolor cinematography by Georges Périnal and Osmond Borradaile."
"In this powerful early noir from the great Akira Kurosawa, Toshiro Mifune bursts onto the screen as a volatile, tubercular criminal who strikes up an unlikely relationship with Takashi Shimura’s jaded physician. Set in and around the muddy swamps and back alleys of postwar Tokyo, DRUNKEN ANGEL is an evocative, moody snapshot of a treacherous time and place, featuring one of the director’s most memorably violent climaxes."
"Winner of the prestigious Golden Bear at the 1964 Berlin International Film Festival, Metin Erksan’s wallop of a melodrama follows the machinations of an unrepentantly selfish tobacco farmer who builds a dam to prevent water from flowing downhill to his neighbors’ crops. Alongside this tale of soul-devouring competition is one of overheated desire, as a love triangle develops between the farmer, his more decent brother, and the beautiful villager the latter takes as his bride. A benchmark of Turkish cinema, this is a visceral, innovatively shot and vibrantly acted depiction of the horrors of greed."
"With this bracing drama, made at the climax of the anti-apartheid movement, director Euzhan Palcy issued a devastating indict­ment of South Africa’s racist government—and made history in the process, becoming the first black woman to direct a Hollywood studio film. White schoolteacher Ben Du Toit (Donald Sutherland) lives in Johannesburg and remains blissfully incurious about the lives of his black countrymen until a wave of brutal treatment comes crashing down on his gardener (Winston Ntshona), bringing Du Toit face-to-face with harsh political realities. Based on a celebrated novel by André Brink and rooted in the first-hand research the Martinican Palcy did in South Africa into the way black people lived under apartheid, A DRY WHITE SEASON is unflinching in its depiction of violence and its chronicling of injustice, making for a galvanizing tribute to those willing to sacrifice everything to fight oppression."
A portrait of black Creole life in the Louisiana Delta.
"The marvelous Marx Brothers are at their anarchic best in this wildly hilarious tour de force of comic invention. When Groucho’s Rufus T. Firefly, president of the bankrupt nation of Freedonia, picks a fight with the ambassador of a neighboring country, absurdist militaristic mayhem ensues in what may the finest and funniest of the brothers’ films, directed by irreverent Hollywood craftsman Leo McCarey. Along the way there are outlandish musical numbers, some of Groucho’s most priceless one-liners, and the pure genius of the classic mirror scene, a wordless, three-minute slice of slapstick perfection."
"As if you need any more reasons to visit the beautiful south of France, Agnès Varda celebrates the splendor of this area in a short documentary funded by the French Tourism Office. In this cheeky little film, Varda highlights the importance of tourism to the region with shots of sunbathers soaking in rays and the attractions that will occupy visitors of all ages."
"“The Neighbor”
"
"An extraordinary, transformative experience, Allan King's DYING AT GRACE is quite simply unprecedented: five terminally ill cancer patients allowed the director access to their final months and days inside the Toronto Grace Health Centre. The result is an unflinching, enormously empathetic contemplation of death, featuring some of the most memorable people ever captured on film."
"A power struggle between the Queen's treasonous lover and a princess occurs amid musical numbers, slapstick battles, and martial arts acrobatics in this over-the-top action comedy produced by Wong Kar-wai."
"This paranoid surveillance thriller unfolds over the course of a tense, turbulent night in the life of Ludvík (Radoslav Brzobohatý), a Communist party official, and his wife Anna (Jiřina Bohdalová). Returning home from a party one evening, the pair discover that their house has been broken into and bugged—and that the state may be listening in on their every word. A number of Ludvík’s colleagues have already been terminated in an ongoing purge: could he be next? Completed in 1970 but banned for twenty years, THE EAR masterfully evokes the ever-present sense of dread that defines life under authoritarianism. "
"In his first film after the commercial and critical success of Tokyo Story, Ozu examines life in postwar Japan through the eyes of a young salaryman, dissatisfied with career and marriage, who begins an affair with a flirtatious co-worker."
"The Mamiya family is seeking a husband for their daughter, Noriko, but she has ideas of her own. Played by the extraordinary Setsuko Hara, Noriko impulsively chooses her childhood friend, at once fulfilling her family’s desires while tearing them apart. A seemingly simple story, EARLY SUMMER is one of Yasujiro Ozu’s most complex works—a nuanced examination of life’s changes across three generations. The Criterion Collection is proud to present one of the director’s most enduring classics."
"The most cherished work from French master Max Ophuls, THE EARRINGS OF MADAME DE . . . is a profoundly emotional, cinematographically adventurous tale of deceptive opulence and tragic romance. When an aristocratic woman known only as Madame de . . . (Danielle Darrieux) sells a pair of earrings given to her by her husband (Charles Boyer) in order to pay some debts, she sets off a chain reaction of financial and carnal consequences that can end only in despair. Ophuls’s adaptation of Louise de Vilmorin’s incisive fin de siècle novel employs to ravishing effect the elegant and precise camera work for which the director is so justly renowned."
"In this two-reeler from 1920, a fast and furious parody of western films, Harold Lloyd stars as an East Coast boy shipped off to a ranch; Mildred Davis, who would later become Lloyd's wife, costars. It is presented here with a new score composed and conducted by Carl Davis."
"A sleeper hit of the early 1980s, EATING RAOUL is a bawdy, gleefully amoral tale of conspicuous consumption. Warhol superstar Mary Woronov and cult legend Paul Bartel (who also directed) portray a prudish married couple who feel put upon by the swingers living in their apartment building. One night, by accident, they discover a way to simultaneously rid themselves of the “perverts” down the hall and realize their dream of opening a restaurant. A mix of hilarious, anything-goes slapstick and biting satire of me-generation self-indulgence, EATING RAOUL marked the end of the sexual revolution with a thwack."
"The first Godzilla film directed by Jun Fukuda, who would go on to direct four more, is fast-paced and light in tone, and builds to a riveting race-against-time finale. On a secluded island in the South Seas, a group of castaways stumble upon a paramilitary organization whose nefarious nuclear activities threaten the world at large—and set the stage for kaiju clashes involving Godzilla, Mothra, and the giant crustacean Ebirah."
"The concluding chapter of Michelangelo Antonioni’s informal trilogy on contemporary malaise (following L’AVVENTURA and LA NOTTE), L’ECLISSE tells the story of a young woman (Monica Vitti) who leaves one lover (Francisco Rabal) and drifts into a relationship with another (Alain Delon). Using the architecture of Rome as a backdrop for the doomed affair, Antonioni achieves the apotheosis of his style in this return to the theme that preoccupied him the most: the difficulty of connection in an alienating modern world."
"This animated short about social conformity tells the story of Edmond - a very 'different' sort of guy. When his co-workers jokingly crown him with a pair of donkey ears, Edmond suddenly discovers his true identity. And while he enjoys his newfound self, the ears create an ever-widening gap between himself and others."
A young woman is married to a much older man and begins a flirtation with one of his close friends that leads to dire consequences.
"Commissioned to make a working-class family drama for public television, up-and-coming director Rainer Werner Fassbinder took the assignment and ran, dodging expectations by depicting social realities in West Germany from a critical—yet far from cynical—perspective. Over the course of five episodes, the sprawling story tracks the everyday triumphs and travails of the young toolmaker Jochen (Gottfried John) and many of the people populating his world, including the woman he loves (Hanna Schygulla), his eccentric family, and his fellow workers, with whom he bands together to improve conditions on the factory floor. Rarely screened since its popular but controversial initial broadcast, EIGHT HOURS DON’T MAKE A DAY rates as a true discovery, one of Fassbinder’s earliest and most tender experiments with the possibilities of melodrama."
"Near the turbulent end of the Edo era, a man returning to Japan after exile in America searches for his wife and becomes swept up in the current of revolution in this incisive period drama from the great Shohei Imamura."
"Lars von Trier’s stunning debut film is the story of Fisher, an exiled ex-cop who returns to his old beat to catch a serial killer with a taste for young girls. Influenced equally by Hitchcock and science fiction, von Trier (EUROPA, BREAKING THE WAVES, THE IDIOTS) boldly reinvents expressionist style for his own cinematic vision of a post-apocalyptic world. Shot in shades of sepia, with occasional, startling flashes of bright blue, THE ELEMENT OF CRIME (FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT) combines dark mystery and operatic sweep to yield a pure celluloid nightmare."
"Set amid the military maneuvers and Quatorze Juillet carnivals of turn-of-the-century France, Jean Renoir’s delirious romantic comedy ELENA AND HER MEN (ELENA ET LES HOMMES) stars a radiant Ingrid Bergman as a beautiful, but impoverished, Polish princess who drives men of all stations to fits of desperate love. When Elena elicits the fascination of a famous general, she finds herself at the center of romantic machinations and political scheming, with the hearts of several men—as well as the future of France—in her hands."
"Robert Flaherty and Zoltán Korda shared best director honors at the Venice Film Festival for collaborating on this charming translation of Rudyard Kipling’s “Jungle Book” story “Toomai of the Elephants.” A harmonious mix of the two filmmakers’ styles, Flaherty's adeptness at ethnographic documentary meeting Korda's taste for grand adventure, ELEPHANT BOY also served as the breakthrough showcase for the thirteen-year-old Sabu, whose beaming performance as a young mahout leading the British on an expedition made him a major international star."
"In Satyajit Ray's second Feluda film, the famous detective investigates the robbery of a priceless deity while on holiday in the beautiful holy city of Benares. In many ways a story about stories, this clever thriller twists and turns its way to a stunning climax."
"One of the most acclaimed feature debuts of the last decade, the first and, tragically, last film from Hu Bo, who took his own life at the age of twenty-nine, is a tour de force of existential fury and transcendent catharsis. Set under the gray skies of China’s industrial north, AN ELEPHANT SITTING STILL traces the intertwining lives of a band of dispossessed souls who come together on a pilgrimage toward a city in Manchuria where a circus elephant is rumored to be sitting still, seemingly oblivious to the pain and tribulations of the world at large. Composed in a series of bravura tracking shots, this profoundly felt epic gathers an overwhelming emotional power as it moves toward its soul-shattering climax."
"For his feature debut, twenty-four-year-old Louis Malle brought together a mesmerizing performance by Jeanne Moreau, evocative cinematography by Henri Decaë, and a now legendary jazz score by Miles Davis. Taking place over the course of one restless Paris night, Malle’s richly atmospheric crime thriller stars Moreau and Maurice Ronet as lovers whose plan to murder her husband (his boss) goes awry, setting off a chain of events that seals their fate. A career touchstone for its director and female star, ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS was an astonishing beginning to Malle’s eclectic body of work, and it established Moreau as one of the most captivating actors ever to grace the screen."
"Produced in Detroit, Michigan by little-known African American filmmaker Richard Maurice, ELEVEN P.M. is a surreal melodrama in which a poor violinist named Sundaisy (Maurice) tries to protect an orphaned girl (Wanda Maurice) from a small-time hoodlum. The story, which may or may not be a dream concocted by a struggling newspaperman, has one of the most bizarre endings in film history, when the spirit of the deceased Sundaisy possesses the body of a dog in order to take vengeance upon the crook."
"Ostensibly a profile of the legendary surrealist poet Louis Aragon, this short documentary instead focuses on his wife, Elsa Triolet, a Prix Goncourt–awarded writer in her own right who nevertheless remains in her husband’s shadow."
"Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes embody the brooding passions of Emily Brontë’s immortal tale of love and revenge in this dark, intensely romantic adaptation from director Peter Kosminsky. Raised together on the Yorkshire moors, the free-spirited Cathy (Binoche) and the foundling Heathcliff (Fiennes, in his film debut) seem destined to be together forever. When she grows up to marry another man, the embittered Heathcliff is set on a path of vengeance. Ryuichi Sakamoto’s haunting score pushes the air of romantic yearning to intoxicating heights."
"This 1966 experimental film by Nobuhiko Obayashi exhibits the bravura visual style and unique approach to horror that would bring the filmmaker's later films, such as House, international attention."
"Of all Paul Robeson’s eleven starring film performances, by far his most iconic was his breakthrough in the big-screen adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’s THE EMPEROR JONES (1933). He was already a legend for his stage incarnation of Brutus Jones, a Pullman porter who powers his way to the rule of a Caribbean island, but with this, his first sound-era film role, his regal image was married to his booming voice for eternity. With THE EMPEROR JONES, Robeson became the first African-American leading man in mainstream movies and, he said, gained a deeper understanding of cinema's potential to change racial misconceptions. Previously censored, THE EMPEROR JONES is presented here in its most complete form."
"With an arresting mix of eroticism and horror, Oshima plunges the viewer into a nightmarish tale of guilt and retribution in EMPIRE OF PASSION (AI NO BOREI). Set in a Japanese village at the end of the nineteenth century, the film details the emotional and physical downfall of a married woman and her younger lover following their decision to murder her husband and dump his body in a well. EMPIRE OF PASSION was Oshima’s only true kaidan (Japanese ghost story), and the film, a savage, unrelenting experience, earned him the best director award at the Cannes Film Festival."
"Bette Gordon explores the cinematic representation of women in this feminist experimental work, which, in the words of the filmmaker, centers on “women’s inability to place and define themselves in language and politics, the location of radical struggle.”"
"Ten years after World War II, five people set out dig up a stash of morphine buried under a butcher shop in this black comedy by Shohei Imamura."
"The Kohayakawa family is thrown into distress when childlike father Manbei takes up with his old mistress, in one of Ozu's most deftly modulated blendings of comedy and tragedy."
"In Satyajit Ray's absorbing contemporary adaptation of a play by Henrik Ibsen, a good-hearted doctor discovers that the serious illness befalling the citizens of his small Bengali town may be due to a contamination of the holy water at the local temple. His findings are met not with public gratitude but with rancor, as well as opposition from local authorities, who are afraid the news will keep visitors away. Stately in style but with a fiery debate at its heart,An Enemy of the People gets at the tension between religion and science in everyday Indian life."
"The singular French director Maurice Pialat puts his distinctive stamp on the lost-youth film with this devastating portrait of a damaged foster child. We watch as ten-year-old François (Michel Terrazon) is shuttled from one home to another, his behavior growing increasingly erratic, his bonds with his surrogate parents perennially fraught. In this, his feature debut, Pialat treats that potentially sentimental scenario with astonishing sobriety and stark realism. With its full-throttle mixture of emotionality and clear-eyed skepticism, L’ENFANCE NUE (NAKED CHILDHOOD) was advance notice of one of the most masterful careers in French cinema, and remains one of Pialat’s finest works."
"Writer Jean Cocteau and director Jean-Pierre Melville joined forces for this elegant adaptation of Cocteau’s immensely popular, wicked novel about the wholly unholy relationship between a brother and sister. Elisabeth (a remarkable Nicole Stéphane) and Paul (Edouard Dermithe) close themselves off from the world by playing an increasingly intense series of mind games with the people who dare enter their lair, until romance and jealousy intrude. Melville’s operatic camera movements and Cocteau’s perverse, poetic approach to character merge in LES ENFANTS TERRIBLES to create one of French cinema’s greatest, and most surprising, meetings of the minds."
"“Life is a beastly mess,” states the great Laurence Olivier in this superb drama of the seedy music-hall life. He plays Archie Rice, a third-rate vaudevillian whose song-and-dance routines are crusty, unappealing, and decidedly boring. His wife (Brenda de Banzie) is a shrewish alcoholic who nags him constantly about his failures. His father (Roger Livesey), a once-famous entertainer, is dying, yet Archie prevails upon him to back just one more tawdry musical revue. Archie’s world comes tumbling down onto the garbage heap he has built up through a life of self-deception, sneaky schemes, and ruthless unconcern for those who love him. Based on the play by Angry Young Man John Osborne and directed by British New Wave trailblazer Tony Richardson, THE ENTERTAINER is built around one of Olivier’s most riveting performances."
"One of the seminal films of the surrealist art movement, ENTR’ACTE (1924) brought together three of the great French artists of its time: Francis Picabia, Erik Satie, and René Clair. Presented in two parts as the introduction and intermission of a ballet, ENTR’ACTE has the twin virtues of formal innovation and extraordinary humor."
"Director Diane Kurys tells the story of her own mother in this tender portrait of the life-changing relationship between two women. In order to avoid deportation, Lena (Isabelle Huppert), a Jewish refugee in World War II–era France, marries Michel (Guy Marchand), with whom she builds a life and family over the next decade. Nevertheless, she remains unfulfilled—until she meets Madeleine (Miou-Miou), a would-be artist similarly dissatisfied with her marriage, and the pair form a close bond that transcends friendship. Nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language film, ENTRE NOUS offers a uniquely sensitive, intimate window into female relationships and the experiences of women in postwar French society."
"Before he took you to a galaxy far, far away, before he brought you face-to-face with living, breathing prehistoric beasts, Dennis Muren, the future nine-time Oscar-winning visual-effects artist (STAR WARS, JURASSIC PARK), joined forces with a group of talented young filmmakers to create an homage to the creature features of yore in the eerie monster mash EQUINOX. Deep within the woods and canyons of California, four teenagers happen upon an ancient book containing the secrets of a strange, malevolent world that coexists with that of mankind. This $6,500-budget wonder (originally called THE EQUINOX . . . A JOURNEY INTO THE SUPERNATURAL) was picked up for distribution by producer Jack H. Harris (THE BLOB), who shot new footage for the film with writer-director Jack Woods and released it in 1970 as EQUINOX. Since then, the film has gained a passionate cult following and inspired succeeding generations of horror/fantasy filmmakers."
"Later in his career, Ozu started becoming increasingly sympathetic with the younger generation, a shift that was cemented in Equinox Flower, his gorgeously detailed first color film, about an old-fashioned father and his newfangled daughter."
"David Lynch’s 1977 debut feature, ERASERHEAD, is both a lasting cult sensation and a work of extraordinary craft and beauty. With its mesmerizing black-and-white photography by Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell, evocative sound design, and unforgettably enigmatic performance by Jack Nance, this visionary nocturnal odyssey continues to haunt American cinema like no other film."
FANTASTIC PLANET was not the first collaboration between writer-director René Laloux and illustrator Roland Topor. Presented here is a short film they made together in the mid-1960s: LES ESCARGOTS.
"Two men at an ironworks encounter roadblocks: the first does not have the grades to get a job, while the other finds himself falling for a co-worker. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
"Jean Cocteau and Jean Delannoy move the classic tale of Tristan and Isolde to 1940's France. Patrice and Nathalie, his uncle's fiance, fall in love. When Nathalie decides to go through with the marriage anyway, Patrice falls for another woman named Nathalie, but can't get the first one out of his head..."
"“You will now listen to my voice . . . On the count of ten you will be in Europa . . .” So begins Max von Sydow’s opening narration to Lars von Trier’s hypnotic EUROPA (known in the U.S. as ZENTROPA), a fever dream in which American pacifist Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) stumbles into a job as a sleeping-car conductor for the Zentropa railways in a Kafkaesque 1945 postwar Frankfurt. With its gorgeous black-and-white and color imagery and meticulously recreated (if then nightmarishly deconstructed) costumes and sets, EUROPA is one of the great Danish filmmaker’s weirdest and most wonderful works, a runaway-train ride to an oddly futuristic past."
"In the Italian-language version of this film, Ingrid Bergman plays a wealthy, self-absorbed Rome socialite racked by guilt over the shocking death of her young son. As a way of dealing with her grief and finding meaning in her life, she decides to devote her time and money to the city’s poor and sick. Her newfound, single-minded activism leads to conflicts with her husband and questions about her sanity. The intense, often overlooked EUROPA ’51 was, according to Rossellini, a retelling of his own THE FLOWERS OF ST. FRANCIS from a female perspective. This unabashedly political but sensitively conducted investigation of modern sainthood was the director’s favorite of his films."
"As World War II splits Europe, sixteen-year-old German Jew Salomon (Marco Hofschneider) is separated from his family after fleeing with them to Poland, and finds himself reluctantly assuming various ideological identities in order to hide the deadly secret of his Jewishness. He is bounced from a Soviet orphanage, where he plays a dutiful Stalinist, to the Russian front, where he hides in plain sight as an interpreter for the German army, and back to his home country, where he takes on his most dangerous role: a member of the Hitler Youth. Based on the real-life experiences of Salomon Perel, Agnieszka Holland’s wartime tour de force EUROPA EUROPA is a breathless survival story told with the verve of a comic adventure, an ironic refutation of the Nazi idea of racial purity, and a complex portrait of a young man caught up in shifting historical calamities and struggling to stay alive."
This short film by Thomas Gislason was produced in 2005.
"In the English-language version of this film, Ingrid Bergman plays a wealthy, self-absorbed Rome socialite racked by guilt over the shocking death of her young son. As a way of dealing with her grief and finding meaning in her life, she decides to devote her time and money to the city’s poor and sick. Her newfound, single-minded activism leads to conflicts with her husband and questions about her sanity. The intense, often overlooked EUROPE ’51 was, according to Rossellini, a retelling of his own THE FLOWERS OF ST. FRANCIS from a female perspective. This unabashedly political but sensitively conducted investigation of modern sainthood was the director’s favorite of his films."
A fraud of a writer (Stanley Baker) becomes deliriously infatuated with Jeanne Moreau’s femme fatale in this Venice-set tale of romantic obsession.
A young sailor romances a beautiful woman named Eva while haunted by the guilt over a deadly accident he caused during childhood.
"EVERGREEN is not only the best British musical ever made, it also features the queen of the London musical stage, Jessie Matthews, in the best roles of her career. Songs by Rodgers and Hart (including their exquisite 'Dancing on the Ceiling') enliven this tale of an Edwardian star who, driven into retirement by her blackmailing ex-husband, is impersonated by her daughter (both are played by Matthews) in order to stage a comeback 20 years later."
"Gu Jun's film for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad Beijing 2008 strikes an adroit balance between the intimate and the spectacular. Gu starts by flitting between various places around the world where individual athletes are training and captures director Zhang Yimou (RAISE THE RED LANTERN, HERO) discussing logistics with his team and imparting his vision for the Opening Ceremony. Gu has what appears to be total access to the competitors, inside and outside the stadia."
"Swedish master Jan Troell, director of the beloved classics THE EMIGRANTS and THE NEW LAND, returns triumphantly with EVERLASTING MOMENTS, the vivid, heartrending story of a woman liberated by art at the beginning of the twentieth century. Though poor and abused by her alcoholic husband, Maria Larsson (Maria Heiskanen, in a beautifully nuanced portrayal) finds an outlet in photography, which opens up her world for the first time. With a burnished bronze tint that evokes faded photographs, and a broad empathetic palette, EVERLASTING MOMENTS, based on a true story, is a miraculous tribute to the power of image making."
"After a decade in the wilds of avant-garde and early video experimentation, Jean-Luc Godard returned to commercial cinema with this star-driven work of social commentary, while remaining defiantly intellectual and formally cutting-edge. EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF, featuring a script by Jean-Claude Carrière and Anne-Marie Miéville, looks at the sexual and professional lives of three people, a television director (Jacques Dutronc), his ex-girlfriend (Nathalie Baye), and a prostitute (Isabelle Huppert), to create a meditative story about work, relationships, and the notion of freedom. Made twenty years into his career, it was, Godard said, his “second first film.”"
"In the formally ravishing Every-Night Dreams, set in the dockside neighborhoods of Tokyo, a single mother works tirelessly as a Ginza bar hostess to ensure a better life for her young son, until her long-lost husband returns."
"A prison in Valencia hosts an event recognizing political prisoners jailed during Franco's rein. The reunion proves more raucous than the organizers intended as a riot breaks out, leaving some to seek another escape."
Everything goes wrong when Jiro tries to break up his mother's relationship with a business man.
"This masterpiece of black humor, beloved in Spain but too little seen elsewhere, threads a scathing critique of Franco-era values through a macabre farce about an undertaker who marries an executioner's daughter and reluctantly takes over her father's job so the family can keep their government-allotted apartment. As caustic today as it was in 1963, this early collaboration between Luis Garcia Berlanga and his longtime screenwriter Rafael Azcona is an unerring depiction of what Berlanga called ""the invisible traps that society sets up for us."" A furiously funny personal attack on capital punishment, THE EXECUTIONER evaded the state censors who sought to suppress it, and today is regarded as one of the greatest Spanish films of all time."
"This short, concerning a father disciplining his son whilst on a road trip, went on to win the Short Film Palme d'or at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival and effectively launched director Jane Campion's feature-filmmaking career."
"THE EXILE is the earliest surviving sound feature by an African American filmmaker. Director Oscar Micheaux responds to the arrival of sound with a change in his visual style, indulging in lengthy dialogue exchanges with few cuts and minimal camera movement. Much of Hollywood went through this same stylistic regression during the dawn of sound, until they wrestled themselves free of the restrictive technology of filming with synchronized audio."
"Atom Egoyan’s acclaimed commercial breakthrough is both a seductive, hypnotic thriller and a shattering meditation on loss and grief. At the eponymous strip club, Francis (Bruce Greenwood), a deeply depressed tax auditor, pays nightly visits to Christina (Mia Kirshner), a young dancer with whom he develops a curiously symbiotic relationship. Swirling around them are Eric (Elias Koteas), the house DJ, who is jealousy possessive of Christina; Zoe (Arsinée Khanjian), the club’s owner, who is pregnant by Eric; and Thomas (Don McKellar), a smuggler of rare bird eggs whose activities Francis is investigating. Each is connected by a history of trauma and despair, the depths of which gradually come into haunting focus."
"Jean Painlevé made numerous research films, strictly with the scientific and university communities in mind. EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT OF A HEMORRHAGE IN A DOG, an educational short about an experimental canine surgery, is presented here in its original silent version. (Presented without score.)"
"Phil Rosenthal created one of the most iconic television families of all time with his hit sitcom “Everybody Loves Raymond.” He was a bona fide expert in his craft. And then . . . the Russians called. In this genuine fish-out-of-water comedy that could only have happened in real life, Phil travels to Russia to help adapt his beloved show for Russian television. The Russians don’t share his taste. They don’t share his sense of humor. But what Phil does discover is a true farce, filled with characters and situations as outlandish as any he could script. Whether you’re a fan of the show or have never seen it, EXPORTING RAYMOND offers a hilarious, wildly entertaining look at what happens when a quintessentially American comedy gets lost in translation."
"A group of high-society friends are invited to a mansion for dinner and find themselves inexplicably unable to leave, in Luis Buñuel’s daring masterpiece THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (EL ÁNGEL EXTERMINADOR). Made just one year after the director’s inter­na­tional sensation VIRIDIANA, this film, full of eerie comic absurdity, continues Buñuel’s wicked takedown of the rituals and dependencies of the frivolous upper classes."
"It seems Rocky was born on the wrong side of luck; all the people he loves die from a fatal accident. First his father, then his grandfather and every single time Rocky is at the center of it all. He is like a magnet for misfortune. Rocky's mom is bitter because she loses her husband and dad. She's unable to comfort Rocky because she is not capable of dealing with her own grief. Celine's cold attitude makes Rocky believe he's the cause of all their misery. It's with these delusional ideas that he grows older. Luckily, Rocky meets Angie, the love of his life. But Angie has her own problems..."
"Visionary cinema historian Mark Cousins (THE STORY OF FILM: AN ODYSSEY) charts the unknown territory of the imagination of one of the twentieth century’s most revolutionary artists. Granted unprecedented access to hundreds of sketches, drawings, and paintings by Orson Welles—tantalizing, never-before-seen glimpses into the filmmaker’s rich inner life—Cousins sheds new light on the experiences, dreams, desires, and obsessions that fueled his creativity and inspired his masterpieces. Playful, profound, and as daringly iconoclastic as its subject, THE EYES OF ORSON WELLES is a one-of-a-kind work of visual archaeology, a fresh way of looking at a cinematic giant whose singular worldview—fiercely humanist, defiantly antiauthoritarian—resonates now more urgently than ever."
"At his secluded chateau in the French countryside, a brilliant, obsessive doctor (Pierre Brasseur) attempts a radical plastic surgery to restore the beauty of his daughter’s disfigured countenance—at a horrifying price. EYES WITHOUT A FACE, directed by the supremely talented Georges Franju, is rare in horror cinema for its odd mixture of the ghastly and the lyrical, and it has been a major influence on the genre in the decades since its release. There are images here—of terror, of gore, of inexplicable beauty—that once seen are never forgotten."
"In THE FABULOUS BARON MUNCHAUSEN, Karel Zeman conjures the adventures of the legendary, boastful baron, whose whirlwind exploits take him from the moon to eighteenth-century Turkey to the belly of a whale and beyond. A kaleidoscopic marvel that blends live action with techniques including stop-motion, cutout collage, puppetry, painted backdrops, and antique tinting, Zeman’s film is an exhilarating visual delight and a warmhearted whirl through a bygone age too entrancing to have existed."
"A staggering work of existential science fiction, THE FACE OF ANOTHER dissects identity with the sure hand of a surgeon. Okuyama (YOJIMBO’s Tatsuya Nakadai), after being burned and disfigured in an industrial accident and estranged from his family and friends, agrees to his psychiatrist’s radical experiment: a face transplant, created from the mold of a stranger. As Okuyama is thus further alienated from the world around him, he finds himself giving in to his darker temptations. With unforgettable imagery, Teshigahara’s film explores both the limits and freedom in acquiring a new persona, and questions the notion of individuality itself."
"John Cassavetes puts a disintegrating marriage under the microscope in the searing FACES. Shot in high-contrast 16 mm black and white, the film follows the futile attempts of the captain of industry Richard (John Marley) and his wife, Maria (Lynn Carlin), to escape the anguish of their empty relationship in the arms of others. Featuring astonishingly nervy performances from Marley, Carlin, and Cassavetes regulars Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, FACES confronts modern alienation and the battle of the sexes with a brutal honesty and compassion rarely matched in cinema."
"An intimate portrait of President John F. Kennedy's funeral in November of 1963, this short work crafted by documentarian Robert Drew captures one of the most solemn moments in U.S. history."
"While a film student in Łódź, Krzysztof Kieślowski portrayed a tortured artist in his classmate Piotr Studzinski’s short THE FACE."
"Krzysztof Kieślowski began his career making documentaries. Presented here is FACTORY, one of his nonfiction shorts."
"A disillusioned killer embarks on his last hit but first he has to overcome his affections for his cool, detached partner. Thinking it's dangerous and improper to become involved with a colleague he sets out to find a surrogate for his affections. Against the sordid and surreal urban nightscape (set in contemporary Hong Kong), he crosses path with a strange drifter looking for her mysterious ex-boyfriend and an amusing mute trying to get the world's attention in his own unconventional ways."
"When Yasu, a member of movie star Ginshiro's entourage, agrees to marry his boss's pregnant mistress to avoid a career-threatening scandal, he takes up dangerous work as a stunt man to support his new family."
"The fractured family of Atom Egoyan’s darkly comic second feature consists of Stan (David Hemblen), a mild sexual sadist; Sandra (Gabrielle Rose), his live-in mistress and video bondage partner; and his seventeen-year old son, Van (Aidan Tierney). Van’s deep resentment of his father becomes the catalyst of a plot to free his beloved grandmother from an old-age home and establish a new, blissfully “happy” family. Egoyan weaves an ironic tale of characters who seem most alive when they’re captured on videotape."
An ill-fated and unconsummated romance between a fan and a flower magically creates a fairy-tale ending.
"Legendary French star Gérard Philipe swashbuckled his way into film history as the peasant soldier Fanfan in Christian-Jaque’s devil-may-care romantic action-comedy. In eighteenth-century France, Fanfan joins King Louis XV’s army to avoid a forced marriage to a local lass and gets himself into close scrapes and tight squeezes with Gina Lollobrigida’s impostor fortune-teller, Adeline, on his way to fighting in the Seven Years’ War. Filled to the brim with dazzling stunts and randy innuendo, FANFAN LA TULIPE, which won the best director prize at Cannes and was a smash hit upon its initial release, remains one of France’s all-time most beloved films."
"The delicate romanticism of The Marseille Trilogy's opening installment encounters harsh reality in this sequel, which picks up moments after Marius has left his would-be wife, Fanny, for a sailor's existence. Soon after his departure, Fanny learns that she is pregnant with his child, to the disappointment of her mother and of Marius's father, César. To secure a better life for her unborn child, she accepts a marriage proposal from the aging widower Honoré Panisse. By turns moving and disarmingly funny, this portrait of heartbreak and its aftermath is buoyed by Pagnol's openheartedness toward his characters, and by director Marc Allégret's vivid and assured depiction of colorful Marseille."
"Directed by Ingmar Bergman • 1983 • Sweden
"
"Through the eyes of ten-year-old Alexander, we witness the delights and conflicts of the Ekdahl family, a sprawling bourgeois clan in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Sweden. Ingmar Bergman intended FANNY AND ALEXANDER as his swan song, and it is the legendary director’s warmest and most autobiographical film, a four-time Academy Award-winning triumph that combines his trademark melancholy and emotional intensity with immense joy and sensuality.  Bergman described Fanny and Alexander as “the sum total of my life as a filmmaker.”"
"Nothing else has ever looked or felt like director René Laloux's animated marvel FANTASTIC PLANET, a politically minded and visually inventive work of science fiction. The film is set on a distant planet called Ygam, where enslaved humans (Oms) are the playthings of giant blue native inhabitants (Draags). After Terr, kept as a pet since infancy, escapes from his gigantic child captor, he is swept up by a band of radical fellow Oms who are resisting the Draags' oppression and violence. With its eerie, coolly surreal cutout animation by Roland Topor; brilliant psychedelic jazz score by Alain Goraguer; and wondrous creatures and landscapes, this Cannes-awarded 1973 counterculture classic is a perennially compelling statement against conformity and violence."
"Classic Hollywood’s arch-poet of romantic mysticism, Frank Borzage, transforms Ernest Hemingway’s classic novel into a feverish paean to the transcendent power of love. Gary Cooper is the troubled American ambulance driver serving in the Italian Army and Helen Hayes the British Red Cross nurse with whom he finds seemingly impossible love amidst the tumult of World War I. It all builds toward a delirious, expressionist climax in which physical and spiritual passion meet death in an ecstatic embrace."
The conflicting dreams of the members of a Japanese family are threatened by a series of misfortunes. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"Five longtime friends get back together, but are disappointed to find that their bonds are not as strong as they once were. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
"Midway through his time in Germany, Bergman returned to Fårö for his second documentary exploration of the remote Swedish island he loved and the socio­economic realities experienced by those who lived there. Longer, more optimistic, and less ascetic than its predecessor, this film charts a calendar year in the life of the island’s 673 inhabitants, many of whom he observes working tirelessly shearing sheep, thatching roofs, and slaughtering livestock, as well as going about various communal rituals. Distilled from twenty-eight hours of material, FÅRÖ DOCUMENT 1979 is a lyrical depiction of life’s cyclical nature."
"Polanski directed this 15-minute black-and-white short just after completing film school. The film features the music of Krzysztof Komeda, who composed the scores for all but one of the director’s films between TWO MEN AND A WARDROBE and ROSEMARY’S BABY (1968)."
"Twelve-year-old Anaïs is fat. Her sister, fifteen-year-old Elena, is a beauty. While the girls are on vacation with their parents, Anaïs tags along as Elena explores the dreary seaside town. Elena meets Fernando, an Italian law student; he seduces her with promises of love, and the ever watchful Anaïs bears witness to the corruption of her sister’s innocence. FAT GIRL is not only a portrayal of female adolescent sexuality and the complicated bond between siblings but also a shocking assertion by the always controversial Catherine Breillat that violent oppression exists at the core of male-female relations."
A middle-aged man's family loses patience with him as he struggles with his seemingly directionless life. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
In 2016 in the small Georgian town of Gori—the birthplace of Joseph Stalin—the Soviet leader’s ardent admirers gather to commemorate the sixty-third anniversary of his death. And then things get strange . . .
"Grégoire (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing), a Parisian film producer, has it all: a beautiful wife, three adorable daughters, wealth, and a buzzing career. On the surface he seems invincible, maintaining humor and charm as he tirelessly juggles the demands of his production company with his family’s needs. But when Grégoire’s reserves—both financial and emotional—reach a dramatic breaking point, his family’s love and resilience is tested. Winner of Cannes’s Un Certain Regard special jury prize, FATHER OF MY CHILDREN is a trenchant portrait of a family in crisis that announced the arrival of Mia Hansen-Løve as one of contemporary cinema’s most remarkable voices."
"Set in a surface mine, two boys sink into a seemingly innocent power game with Mother Nature as the sole observer."
"An adulterous, anxiety-ridden wife is blackmailed by the jealous ex-girlfriend of her lover. Directed by Roberto Rossellini."
"Jackie Chan’s former producer Lo Wei used outtakes from Chan’s directorial debut THE FEARLESS HYENA along with stand-ins and newly shot footage to cobble together this sequel. This time around, Chan is cast as Chan Lung, one of the last surviving members of his clan, who teams up with his cousin in order to avenge the deaths of their fathers, who were murdered by a pair of villains known as the the Heaven and Earth Devils. Despite its patchwork origins, FEARLESS HYENA 2 packs in enough breathless battles—and some choice Chan footage that would otherwise have been left on the cutting-room floor—to make it a worthy follow-up."
"Jackie Chan made his directorial debut with this rollicking martial-arts comedy, a fiercely entertaining showcase for his superhuman agility and daredevil spirit. He stars as Shing Lung, a lazy but gifted fighter who, when his grandfather is murdered by a rival martial-arts master, must whip himself into shape in order to exact revenge. Among the film’s marvelously innovative set pieces are a duel with chopsticks and a memorable demonstration of “emotional kung fu.”"
A woman in a stable-but-passionless marriage suddenly begins to lose her mind when she becomes pregnant with her second child.
"This short was originally one of the sequences of AS LONG AS YOU’RE HEALTHY, in its 1965 version. In 1971, Pierre Etaix re-edited it to a short feature: FEELING GOOD. In 2010, it was presented in the general reissue of his films."
"The second and most popular talkie starring Harold Lloyd, FEET FIRST has the actor playing an upstart shoe salesman who pretends to be a millionaire tycoon in order to impress a young lady he meets in Honolulu. Directed by Clyde Bruckman, the film features some of Lloyd's most daring thrill-comedy stunts."
"Before WOODSTOCK and MONTEREY POP, there was FESTIVAL. From 1963 through 1966, Murray Lerner visited the annual Newport Folk Festival to document a thriving, idealistic musical movement as it reached its peak as a popular phenomenon. Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Howlin’ Wolf, Johnny Cash, the Staple Singers, Pete Seeger, Son House, and Peter, Paul and Mary were just a few of the legends who shared the stage at Newport, treating audiences to a range of folk music that encompassed the genre’s roots in blues, country, and gospel as well as its newer flirtations with rock and roll. Shooting in gorgeous black and white, Lerner juxtaposes performances with snapshot interviews with artists and their fans, weaving footage from four years of the festival into an intimate record of a pivotal time in music—and in American culture at large."
"Trickery. Deceit. Magic. In F FOR FAKE, a free-form sort-of documentary by Orson Welles, the legendary filmmaker (and self-described charlatan) gleefully reengages with the central preoccupation of his career: the tenuous lines between illusion and truth, art and lies. Beginning with portraits of the world-renowned art forger Elmyr de Hory and his equally devious biographer, Clifford Irving, Welles embarks on a dizzying journey that simultaneously exposes and revels in fakery and fakers of all stripes, not the least of whom is Welles himself. Charming and inventive, F FOR FAKE is an inspired prank and a clever examination of the essential duplicity of cinema."
"Directed by Agnès Varda for her film CLÉO FROM 5 TO 7, this short film stars her French new wave colleagues Jean-Luc Godard, Anna Karina, Sami Frey, and Eddie Constantine."
"Khalik Allah’s stunning feature debut combines elements of urban street portraiture, observational documentary, and avant-garde technique to create a hallucinatory sensory experience. Filmed around the intersection of 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in New York City’s East Harlem, this audiovisual collage captures, with profound humanity, the faces and personalities of the homeless residents and neighborhood regulars who congregate there. Set to asynchronous shards of interviews, these indelible portraits take on an almost ecstatic spiritual dimension even as they reveal cutting truths about addiction, poverty, race, and class in America."
"As the harvest approaches in a small Indian town, Lalla, a poor agricultural laborer caught in an unsatisfying marriage, risks everything to find the sense of fulfillment she has been denied."
"A scientist’s thoughts materialize as an army of invisible brain-shaped monsters (complete with spinal-cord tails!) who terrorize an American military base in this nightmarish chiller, directed by Arthur Crabtree (HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM). This outstanding sci-fi/horror hybrid is a special effects bonanza, and a high-water mark in British genre filmmaking."
"High schooler Kiroku Nanbu yearns for the prim, Catholic Michiko, but her only desire is to reform Kiroku’s sinful tendencies. Hormones raging, Kiroku channels his unsatisfied lust into the only outlet available: savage, crazed violence. FIGHTING ELEGY (KENKA EREJII) is a unique masterpiece in the diverse career of Seijun Suzuki, combining the director’s signature bravura visual style with a brilliantly focused satire of machismo and fascism."
"Twelve years had passed since the last edition of the Olympic Games when nations finally came together again, in the wake of World War II, to carry on the Olympic tradition at the V Olympic Winter Games St. Moritz 1948. The tone of André Michel's FIGHT WITHOUT HATE is thus not surprisingly upbeat. Featuring enthusiastic commentary, outstanding camera work, and slick editing, the film proves that an exhilarating new era was under way in the Winter Olympic Games."
"Charles Burnett cannily blends documentary and dramatic action with this searing, savagely ironic tale of a bank employee reduced to living out of his car, in a character study that doubles as a compassionate portrait of Los Angeles’s homeless community."
"The first nonfiction film to win the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival, the Academy Award–nominated FIRE AT SEA takes place in Lampedusa, a remote Mediterranean island that has become a major entry point for refugees into Europe. There, we meet Samuele, a twelve-year-old boy who lives simply, climbing rocks by the shore and playing with his slingshot. Nearby, we bear witness as thousands of men, women, and children risk their lives to make the brutal crossing from Africa. Acclaimed director Gianfranco Rosi masterfully juxtaposes these realities, jolting the audience into a new understanding of what is happening in the region, the heavy toll of the migrant crisis, and the price of freedom."
"A milestone of the Czech New Wave, Miloš Forman’s first color film THE FIREMEN’S BALL is both a dazzling comedy and a provocative political satire. A hilarious saga of good intentions confounded, the story chronicles a firemen’s ball where nothing goes right, from a beauty pageant whose reluctant participants embarrass the organizers to a lottery from which nearly all the prizes are pilfered. Presumed to be a commentary on the floundering Czech leadership, the film was “banned forever” in Czechoslovakia following the Russian invasion and prompted Forman’s move to America."
"An agonizing portrait of desperate Japanese soldiers stranded in a strange land during World War II, Kon Ichikawa’s FIRES ON THE PLAIN is a compelling descent into psychological and physical oblivion. Denied hospital treatment for tuberculosis and cast off into the unknown, Private Tamura treks across an unfamiliar Philippine landscape, encountering an increasingly debased cross section of Imperial Army soldiers, who eventually give in to the most terrifying craving of all. Grisly yet poetic, FIRES ON THE PLAIN is one of the most powerful works from one of Japanese cinema’s most versatile filmmakers."
"After garnering international acclaim for such seminal crowd-pleasers as THE LOVERS and ZAZIE DANS LE MÉTRO, Louis Malle gave his fans a shock with THE FIRE WITHIN (LE FEU FOLLET), a penetrating study of individual and social inertia. Maurice Ronet (ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS), in an implosive, haunted performance, plays Alain Leroy, a self-destructive writer who resolves to kill himself and spends the next twenty-four hours trying to reconnect with a host of wayward friends. Unsparing in its portrait of Alain’s inner turmoil and shot with remarkable clarity, THE FIRE WITHIN is one of Malle’s darkest and most personal films."
A fishing union depends on two brothers to make up the losses caused by the dishonest captains they replaced. Keisuke Kinoshita directs.
"Caroline Rowland's FIRST is influenced by Bud Greenspan's method of profiling selected competitors in depth and continuing with an account of how they performed at the Games, often in their own words. Rowland's twist is that she chooses all first-time Olympians."
"In this interstellar cautionary tale, brash U.S. Navy test pilot Dan Prescott, hungry for fame, rockets himself beyond Earth's atmosphere, only to become encrusted with cosmic dust and return a blood-drinking monster."
"The true story of R.J. Mitchell (portrayed here producer/director Leslie Howard), a gifted aircraft designer whose insightful engineer designs between the two World Wars were matched by his prescient fear of German militarism. Knowing that he has a terminal illness, and sacrificing the little time left to him, Mitchell pushes forward with his design and perfection of the Spitfire fighter, bequeathing to England the plane that won the Battle of Britain."
"British director Andrea Arnold won the Cannes Jury Prize for the intense and invigorating FISH TANK, about a fifteen-year-old girl, Mia (electrifying newcomer Katie Jarvis), who lives with her mother and sister in the housing projects of Essex. Mia’s adolescent conflicts and emerging sexuality reach a boiling point when her mother’s new boyfriend (a lethally attractive Michael Fassbender) enters the picture. In her young career, Arnold has already proven herself to be a master of social realism, evoking the work of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach; and she invests her sympathetic portraits of dead-end lives with a poetic, earthy sensibility all her own. FISH TANK heralds the official arrival of a major new filmmaker."
"Sergio Leone made Clint Eastwood a superstar and the spaghetti western an international sensation with the boldly stylized first film in his celebrated Dollars Trilogy. An unofficial remake of Akira Kurosawa’s YOJIMBO, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS tells the story of the Man with No Name (Eastwood), a taciturn gunfighter who, when he receives offers from two gangs terrorizing a small town, accepts both, setting into motion a plan to destroy the criminals in a series of operatically orchestrated setups, showdowns, and deadly confrontations, all set to Ennio Morricone’s iconic score."
"Tormented by twisted desires, a young man takes drastic measures to rid his grotesquely dysfunctional family of its various afflictions, in this astonishing 1965 debut from Marco Bellocchio. With its coolly assured style, shocking perversity, and savage gallows humor, FISTS IN THE POCKET (I PUGNI IN TASCA) was a gleaming ice pick in the eye of bourgeois family values and Catholic morality, a truly unique work that continues to rank as one of the great achievements of Italian cinema."
"As she bounces from job to job, a thirtysomething woman must summon all her resilience in order to survive a whirlwind day in the contemporary gig economy of New York City."
"Eleven-year-old tomboy Toni (a showstopping Royalty Hightower) is bewitched by the tight-knit dance team she sees practicing in the same Cincinnati gymnasium where she boxes. Enamored by the power and confidence of the strong community of girls, Toni spends less and less time boxing with her older brother, and instead eagerly absorbs the dance routines and masters drills from a distance, even piercing her own ears in an effort to fit in. But when a mysterious outbreak of fainting spells plagues the team, Toni’s desire for acceptance becomes more complicated. A wash of stunningly visceral images set to a mesmerizing score, the tour-de-force feature debut from Anna Rose Holmer is a transfixing sensory experience and a potent portrait of adolescent turmoil."
"Tony Bill's ensemble piece, featuring an extraordinary cast (Jodie Foster, John Turturro, Tim Robbins), is an urban romance set against the youthful idealism and the matter-of-fact violence of a working-class Bronx neighborhood in the early '60s. With an original screenplay by John Patrick Shanley, FIVE CORNERS continues to grow in stature with the passing time."
"An adolescent girl meets a boy while on holiday with her cousins. This short film, created in 2009 by Andrew Haigh, provides some insight into the director’s evolving vision."
A young dockworker who owes his life to his boss becomes embroiled in union activity. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda.
"One of the ineffably lovely domestic sagas made by Yasujiro Ozu at the height of his mastery, THE FLAVOR OF GREEN TEA OVER RICE is a sublimely piercing portrait of a marriage coming quietly undone. Secrets and deceptions strain the already tenuous relationship of a childless, middle-aged couple, as the wife’s city-bred sophistication bumps up against the husband’s small-town simplicity, and a generational sea change—in the form of her headstrong, modern niece—sweeps over their household. The director’s abiding concern with family dynamics receives one of its most spirited treatments, with a wry, tender humor and buoyant expansiveness that moves the action from the home into the baseball stadiums, pachinko parlors, and ramen shops of postwar Tokyo."
"Set in Japan after World War II, a young woman fights to find happiness in spite of the betrayals of her lover."
"In 1959, Yasujiro Ozu remade his 1934 silent classic A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS in color with the celebrated cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa (RASHOMON, UGETSU). Setting his later version in a seaside location, Ozu otherwise preserves the details of his elegantly simple plot wherein an aging actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his former lover and illegitimate son, a scenario that enrages his current mistress and results in heartbreak for all. Together, the films offer a unique glimpse into the evolution of one of cinema’s greatest directors. A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS reveals Ozu in the midst of developing his mode of expression; FLOATING WEEDS reveals his distinct style at its pinnacle. In each, the director captures the joy and sadness in everyday life."
"In a series of simple and joyous vignettes, director Roberto Rossellini and co-writer Federico Fellini lovingly convey the universal teachings of the People’s Saint: humility, compassion, faith, and sacrifice. Gorgeously photographed to evoke the medieval paintings of Saint Francis’s time, and cast with monks from the Nocera Inferiore Monastery, THE FLOWERS OF ST. FRANCIS is a timeless and moving portrait of the search for spiritual enlightenment."
"Many viewers will likely find elements in Mikio Naruse's Flowing (aka Nagageru) (1956) that recall Kenji Mizoguchi's earlier Street of Shame and The Life of Oharu -- its story of the denizens of a geisha house that is slowly sinking in debt and a changing world echoes key aspects of both films, especially with Kinoyu Tanaka playing a role here, as the brothel operator, similar to her part in Mizoguchis Life of Oharu. But with Naruse's frequent leading actress Hideko Takemine as the daughter, his own stamp is quite visible throughout the proceedings. Still others may find it a kind of Japanese answer to Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, as a story about lost souls in a decaying surrounded by a changing world. The vivid textures of the acting and characterizations transcend the particulars of its setting, however, and the performances of the two lead actresses impart a universally accessible urgency to the story."
"Mikio Naruse's earliest available film, Flunky, Work Hard is the rare work by the director not to center around female characters. It is a charming, breezy short concerning an impoverished insurance salesman and his scrappy son, whose fisticuffs with the other boys of their village put his father's livelihood in jeopardy."
"Unlike his 1923 film REGENERATION, Richard Norman’s THE FLYING ACE exists in its entirety, and the image quality is stunning. A rural crime drama revolving around a pair of rival aviators, THE FLYING ACE illuminates the fact that many films made for African American audiences were less concerned with race than with making popular entertainment in the traditional Hollywood style. Filmed in the Arlington area of Jacksonville, Florida, THE FLYING ACE is a unique aviation melodrama in that no airplanes actually leave the ground (the spectacular flight scenes being performed on terra firma, in front of neutral backdrops). Norman divided the film into four chapters, so that exhibitors could show the film as a feature or as a four-episode serial. The film is buoyed by the presence of Norman Studios regular Steve “Peg” Reynolds as the hero’s one-legged sidekick, who in one memorable scene rides a bicycle while firing a rifle built into the shaft of his crutch."
"Before he became a sensation with the twisty revenge story MEMENTO, Christopher Nolan fashioned this low-budget, 16 mm black-and-white neonoir with comparable precision and cunning. Providing irrefutable evidence of Nolan’s directorial bravura, FOLLOWING is the fragmented tale of an unemployed young writer who trails strangers through London, hoping that they will provide inspiration for his first novel. He gets more than he bargained for when one of his unwitting subjects leads him down a dark criminal path. With gritty aesthetics and a made-on-the-fly vibe (many shots were simply stolen on the streets, unbeknownst to passersby), FOLLOWING is a mind-bending psychological journey that shows the remarkable beginnings of one of today’s most acclaimed filmmakers."
"FOOTLIGHT PARADE is sheer cinematic joy. In this Depression-era romp, a timid stenographer (Ruby Keeler) removes her glasses and—wow!—she’s a star. A gee-whiz tenor (Dick Powell) asserts his independence. Plucky chorines tap, greedy hangers-on get their comeuppances, and an indefatigable producer/dancer (James Cagney) and his girl Friday (Joan Blondell) work showbiz miracles to stage live prologues for talkie houses to keep their company afloat during hard times. “Honeymoon Hotel,” “By a Waterfall,” and “Shanghai Lil” are the shows, directed by Busby Berkeley and filled with imagination-bending sets, startling camera angles, kaleidoscopic pageantry, and a twenty-thousand-gallon-per-minute waterfall. Curtain up!"
This early short by Jaromil Jireš anticipates the formal and stylistic experimentation that would characterize VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS.
"In July 1969, the space race ended when Apollo 11 fulfilled President Kennedy’s challenge of “landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.” No one who witnessed the lunar landing will ever forget it. Al Reinert’s documentary FOR ALL MANKIND is the story of the twenty-four men who traveled to the moon, told in their words, in their voices, using the images of their experiences. Forty years after the first moon landing, it remains the most radical, visually dazzling work of cinema yet made about this earthshaking event."
"In 1940, Alfred Hitchcock made his official transition from the British film industry to Hollywood. And it was quite a year: his first two American movies, REBECCA and FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, were both nominated for the best picture Oscar. Though REBECCA prevailed, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT is the more quintessential Hitch film. A full-throttle espionage thriller, starring Joel McCrea as a green Yank reporter sent to Europe to get the scoop on the imminent war, it’s wall-to-wall witty repartee, head-spinning plot twists, and brilliantly mounted suspense set pieces, including an ocean plane crash climax with astonishing special effects. FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT deserves to be mentioned alongside THE 39 STEPS and NORTH BY NORTHWEST as one of the master’s greatest adventures."
"FOREIGN LAND (FREMDLAND), made in 1984, was Götz Spielmann’s debut short. It won first prize at the European Film Academy Awards."
"Sonya, a seventeen-year-old Russian immigrant, lives in a claustrophobic Brooklyn apartment with her dad and his ever-growing menagerie of cats. When the landlady threatens to kick them out, Sonya is forced to make an unimaginable decision to protect her aging father and herself."
"Romantic triangle featuring hefty Metropolitan Opera tenor Gigli as a widowed tenor who becomes involved with and marries young British clerical worker Gardner, who is on the emotional rebound after a frustrating romance with handsome ship's officer Brandt. Trouble looms on the horizon, however, when Gardner and Brandt run into each other while Gigli is on a spectacularly successful world tour. The former lovers are soon mooning over each other again, much to the dismay of Gigli, who becomes so emotionally distraught that he can't perform."
"The Uptown Boy, J. Harold Manners (Lloyd) is a millionaire playboy who falls for the Downtown Girl, Hope (Ralston) who works in Brother Paul's (Weigel) mission. In order to build up attendance, and win Hope's attention, Harold runs through town causing trouble, and winds up with a crowd chasing him right into the mission. He eventually wins the girl and they marry, but not without some interference from his high-brow friends."
"Jacques Tati directed this twenty-seven minute short, documenting a Dutch-French soccer match, in 1978. He never finished editing it, but his daughter Sophie Tatischeff discovered the footage and completed the film for release in 2000."
"Before TINY FURNITURE, director Lena Dunham made a number of short films, one of which is presented here."
"FOUNTAINHEAD (1956, aka IZUMI) is one of Masaki Kobayashi's ""comeback"" films into the Japanese studio system, a mainstream lyrical romantic drama that proved the commercial appeal of his work. It was also the place where he started setting the stage for his later career, assembling the cast members who would populate his more personal movies in the years to come: Fumio Watanabe (in his screen debut), who would star in Kobayashi's BLACK RIVER and work in the director's THE HUMAN CONDITION II; leading lady Ineko Arima, who had previously been associated with the films of Nikio Naruse, and who would later also star in BLACK RIVER and THE HUMAN CONDITION I; and Keiji Sada, who would work in THE HUMAN CONDITION I. This was the director's second film with a screenplay by Zenzo Matsuyama, who would be a close collaborator with him across this period of his career up through THE HUMAN CONDITION."
"This Technicolor spectacular, directed by Zoltán Korda, is considered the finest of the many adaptations of A. E. W. Mason’s classic 1902 adventure novel about the British empire’s exploits in Africa, and a crowning achievement of Alexander Korda’s legendary production company, London Films. Set at the end of the nineteenth century, THE FOUR FEATHERS follows the travails of a young officer (John Clements) accused of cowardice after he resigns his post on the eve of a major deployment to Khartoum; he must then fight to redeem himself in the eyes of his fellow officers (including Ralph Richardson) and fiancée (June Duprez). Featuring music by Miklós Rózsa and Oscar-nominated cinematography by Georges Périnal and Osmond Borradaile, THE FOUR FEATHERS is a thrilling, thunderous epic."
"On assignment for the mathematics department of le Palais de la Découverte, Jean Painlevé shot this film to be presented at the Paris museum’s 1937 international exhibition. THE FOURTH DIMENSION takes a look at how we interact with dimensional space."
"A lottery win leads not to financial and emotional freedom but to social captivity, in this wildly cynical classic about love and exploitation by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Casting himself against type, the director plays a suggestible working-class innocent who lets himself be taken advantage of by his bourgeois new boyfriend and his circle of materialistic friends, leading to the kind of resonant misery that only Fassbinder could create. FOX AND HIS FRIENDS is unsparing social commentary, an amusingly pitiless and groundbreaking if controversial depiction of a gay community in 1970s West Germany."
"Greta Gerwig is radiant as Frances, a woman in her late twenties in contemporary New York trying to sort out her ambitions, her finances, and, above all, her intimate but shifting bond with her best friend, Sophie (Mickey Sumner). Meticulously directed by Noah Baumbach with a free-and-easy vibe reminiscent of the French New Wave’s most spirited films, and written by Baumbach and Gerwig with an effortless combination of sweetness and wit, FRANCES HA gets at both the frustrations and the joys of being young and unsure of where to go next. This wry and sparkling city romance is a testament to the ongoing vitality of independent American cinema."
"Nineteenth-century Paris comes vibrantly alive in Jean Renoir’s exhilarating tale of the opening of the world-renowned Moulin Rouge. Jean Gabin plays the wily impresario Danglard, who makes the cancan all the rage while juggling the love of two beautiful women—an Egyptian belly-dancer and a naive working girl turned cancan star. This celebration of life, art and the City of Light (with a cameo by Edith Piaf) is a Technicolor tour de force by a master of modern cinema."
"Harold Lloyd’s biggest box-office hit was this silent comedy gem, featuring the befuddled everyman at his eager best as a new college student. Though he dreams of being a big man on campus, the freshman’s careful plans inevitably go hilariously awry, be it on the football field or at the Fall Frolic. But he gets a climactic chance to prove his mettle—and impress the sweet girl he loves—in one of the most famous sports sequences ever filmed. This crowd-pleaser is a gleeful showcase for Lloyd’s slapstick brilliance and incandescent charm, and it is accompanied here by a new orchestral score by Carl Davis."
The academic and the fantastic merge in Jean Painlevé’s educational film about the food chain in a freshwater pond.
"FROM THE EAST retraces a journey from the end of summer to deepest winter, from East Germany, across Poland and the Baltics, to Moscow. It is a voyage Chantal Akerman wanted to make shortly after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, “before it was too late,” reconstructing her impressions in the manner of a documentary on the border of fiction. By filming “everything that touched me,” Akerman sifts through and fixes upon sounds and images as she follows the thread of this subjective crossing. Unfolding without dialogue or commentary, FROM THE EAST takes the form of a cinematic elegy."
"Ingmar Bergman's From The Life of the Marionettes was a semi-sequel to Scenes From A Marriage, made seven years before, with a different pair of actors (Robert Atzorn, Christine Buchegger) replacing the original's Jan Malmjso and Bibi Andersson. Bergman let his storytelling skills roam freely in this film, drawing from his cinematic and theatrical experience (as a playwright as well as a director), cutting forward and backward in a visual and narrative tour-de-force that rivaled his best experimental work of the 1960s."
"In images of eerie, painterly beauty, Chantal Akerman explores the border between the United States and Mexico. For years, undocumented immigrants passed through San Diego, until the use of new technology began stemming the flow of people. This leaves only the mountains and deserts of Arizona for those desperate enough to try their luck. And it is here that Akerman shifts her focus, between Agua Prieta, Sonora, and Douglas, Arizona, and the desert in between. Mixing evocative landscapes and interviews with the families of immigrants, American sheriffs, local residents, and advocates, she creates a profound, compassionate reflection on U.S. border policy and xenophobia."
Based on the Broadway play of the same name (which was also the basis for Howard Hawks’ HIS GIRL FRIDAY) THE FRONT PAGE is a screwball comedy focusing on two newspapermen hoping to capitalize on a story about an escaped prisoner.
"Longtime Safdie brothers collaborator Ronald Bronstein has described his lone directorial effort as “a rotten egg lobbed with bad aim at the silver screen.” Be forewarned: audience response has been intensely divided. FROWNLAND has garnered both passionate raves and scathing denunciations, while festival screenings have ended in screaming matches between patrons. It's strong stuff, yes, but none of its notorious reputation does justice to its savage dark humor, emotional heft, and stylistic audacity. Above all else, FROWNLAND is a pitch-black character study of Keith Sontag (Dore Mann), a neurotic, manipulative, stridently unlovable New Yorker whose pitiless roommate aptly describes him, to his face, as “a burbling troll in his underwear.” With the most basic elements of human communication a struggle, Keith lurches his way through an uncaring city, attempting to aid a suicidal friend, evict his unctuous roommate, and simply attain some measure of self-respect. An apoplectic seizure of blind rage, sorrow, and bleating humor . . . FROWNLAND."
"On the night of Ted Bundy’s execution, a teenage girl photographing the accompanying media circus has her own sinister encounter with a seemingly charming young man."
"Calling on a wide range of her father's collaborators and fellow travelers, from James Franco to William Friedkin, to read from his autobiography, the filmmaker Samantha Fuller evokes the inimitable voice and spirit of her father, the legendary writer-director Sam Fuller. Shot entirely within ""The Shack,"" as Fuller called the backyard writing refuge he filled with notes for future projects, the film follows Fuller on his path from New York tabloid journalist to Hollywood hyphenate including his formative experiences as an infantryman in World War II."
"When Wabisuke's father-in-law unexpectedly dies, the family goes through a series of random events and occurrences as the funeral unfolds over three days in their home."
"Michael Haneke’s most notorious provocation, FUNNY GAMES spares no detail in its depiction of the agony of a bourgeois family held captive at their vacation home by a pair of white-gloved young men. In a series of escalating “games,” the sadistic duo subject their victims to unspeakable physical and psychological torture over the course of a night. A home-invasion thriller in which the genre’s threat of bloodshed is made stomach-churningly real, the film ratchets up shocks even as its executioners interrupt the action to address the audience, drawing queasy attention to the way that cinema milks pleasure from pain and stokes our appetite for atrocity. With this controversial treatise on violence and entertainment, Haneke issued a summation of his cinematic philosophy, implicating his audience in a spectacle of unbearable cruelty."
"Dick (George Segal) and Jane (Jane Fonda) are an upwardly mobile young couple building a picture-perfect life for themselves. They have an eleven-year-old son named Billy, a dog named Spot, a fine house in the suburbs, and a mailbox crammed with bills. When Dick’s boss (Ed McMahon) lays him off from his job, the two hit upon a most unconventional scheme—armed robbery—in order to maintain their comfortable lifestyle. This wicked satire from director Ted Kotcheff delivers uproarious comic set pieces alongside a barbed takedown of bourgeois values."
"Born out of her roots in experimental theater, Miranda July’s follow-up to her breakout indie hit ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW stars the filmmaker and Hamish Linklater as a directionless couple living in a state of deferred adulthood whose decision to adopt a dying cat triggers an unexpected existential crisis that jolts them out of their malaise. With her inimitable ability to blend flights of whimsical fantasy with piercing emotional insight, July weaves an audacious tale of time bending, talking cats, and sentient T-shirts that yields complex truths about the human condition."
"Jacques Tati and Enrico Sprocani, a famous clown who went by the name Rhum, cowrote and costar in this twenty-one minute short. Directed by Jacques Berr, it tells the story of a couple of city tramps who hatch a clever moneymaking scheme."
"Director Peter Weir captures a decisive moment in Australian history in one of the most shattering antiwar films ever made. Opening in Western Australia in 1915, GALLIPOLI follows Archy Hamilton (Mark Lee) and Frank Dunne (Mel Gibson), two sprinters and friends, as they eagerly enlist in the First Australian Imperial Force during World War I, are sent to Egypt for training, and find themselves on the frontlines of the doomed Gallipoli campaign. As much a war film as it is an exploration of Australian identity, this heartrending drama offers a powerfully human perspective on an event that would prove formative in the development of the country’s awakening national consciousness."
"Restored by the IOC and in 2016 edited into an absorbing chronicle, THE GAMES OF THE V OLYMPIAD STOCKHOLM, 1912 presents not just individual events but also the ceremonial ones before, during, and after the Games, which offer a vivid impression of Swedish society prior to World War I."
"Director Jean-Claude Labrecque elected to focus on individual athletes, both in competition and out, instead of sticking to the rigidly in place Olympics program. Labrecque and his co-directors (Jean Beaudin, Marcel Carrière and Georges Dufaux) have a good eye for small, offbeat details and give prominence to the coaches, mechanics, and the innumerable other personnel who made up the action at the Games of the XXI Olympiad Montreal 1976."
"Straining the conventions of blaxploitation and horror through a singular avant-garde sensibility, Bill Gunn’s revolutionary independent landmark GANJA & HESS is a highly stylized and utterly original treatise on sex, religion, and African American identity. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD’s Duane Jones stars as anthropologist Hess Green, who is stabbed with an ancient ceremonial dagger by his unstable assistant (Gunn), bestowing upon him the blessing of immortality . . . and the curse of an unquenchable thirst for blood. When the assistant’s beautiful and outspoken wife Ganja (Marlene Clark) comes searching for her missing husband, she and Hess form an unexpected partnership. Together, they explore just how much power blood holds."
Filmmaker Les Blank breezily questions our commonly accepted standards of beauty with this paean to women with extra-wide dental spaces.
A student at a woman's university takes a controversial action against the school's old-fashioned doctrines. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"In this love letter to “the stinking rose,” documentarian Les Blank interviews garlic fanatics of all stripes, from cooks to members of garlic appreciation societies."
"In the shady black markets and bombed-out hovels of post-World War II Tokyo, a tough band of prostitutes eke out a dog-eat-dog existence, maintaining tenuous friendships and a semblance of order in a world of chaos. But when a renegade ex-soldier stumbles into their midst, lusts and loyalties clash, with tragic results. With GATE OF FLESH, visionary director Seijun Suzuki delivers a whirlwind of social critique and pulp drama, shot through with brilliant colors and raw emotions."
"A winner of Academy Awards for best foreign-language film and best costume design, GATE OF HELL is a visually sumptuous, psychologically penetrating work from Teinosuke Kinugasa. In the midst of epic, violent intrigue in twelfth-century Japan, an imperial warrior falls for a lady-in-waiting; after he discovers she is married, he becomes frenzied in his attempts to win her love. Kinugasa’s film, an early triumph of color cinematography in Japan, is an unforgettable, tragic story of obsession and unrequited passion."
"Errol Morris burst out of the gate with this brilliant debut feature, about two pet cemeteries in Northern California and the people involved with them. Such a description, however, can hardly do justice to the captivating, funny, and enigmatic GATES OF HEAVEN, a film that is about our relationships to our pets, each other, and ourselves. Both sincere and satirical, this is an endlessly surprising study of human nature."
"In 1979, artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude proposed one of the largest artworks in history: a “golden river” of 7,503 fabric-paneled gates in Central Park. While Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s artistic vision sought to unite all of New York City, the public likened the project to the “defacement of a masterpiece,” akin to putting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. Over twenty years later, under a new mayor, the project was approved and finally completed in February 2005. THE GATES chronicles the evolution of the project from concept to realization, as it ultimately overcomes public disapproval and transforms Central Park into a visual symphony of color and light. The work—which was entirely financed by the artists and which ultimately brought over four million visitors from around the world to Central Park in midwinter—has been lovingly memorialized in this fascinating look at the creation of a modern masterpiece."
"In 1974, Barbet Schroeder went to Uganda to make a film about Idi Amin, the country’s ruthless, charismatic dictator. Three years into a murderous regime that would be responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ugandans, Amin prepared a triumphal greeting for the filmmakers, staging rallies, military maneuvers, and cheery displays of national pride, and envisioning the film as an official portrait to adorn his cult of personality. Schroeder, however, had other ideas, emerging with a disquieting, caustically funny brief against Amin, in which the dictator’s own endless stream of testimony—by turns charming, menacing, and nonsensical—serves as the most damning evidence. A revelatory tug-of-war between subject and filmmaker, GENERAL IDI AMIN DADA: A SELF-PORTRAIT is a landmark in the art of documentary and an appalling study of egotism in power."
"Stach is a wayward teen living in squalor on the outskirts of Nazi-occupied Warsaw. Guided by an avuncular Communist organizer, he is introduced to the underground resistance, and to the beautiful Dorota. Soon he is engaged in dangerous efforts to fight oppression and indignity, maturing as he assumes responsibility for others’ lives. A coming-of-age story of survival and shattering loss, A GENERATION delivers a brutal portrait of the human cost of war."
"The insects are taking over in this nasty piece of disaster horror directed by Kazui Nihonmatsu. A group of military personnel transporting a hydrogen bomb are left to figure out how and why swarms of killer bugs took down their plane; the answer is more deliriously nihilistic, and convoluted, than you could imagine. Also known as War of the Insects, Genocide enacts a cracked doomsday scenario like no other."
"This film of a barge trip down the Po River is, along with N.U., one of several early nonfiction shorts by Michelangelo Antonioni to look at the relationship between individuals and their environment, a theme the director would fully explore in such films as RED DESERT. It was made between 1943 and 1947."
"An upscale Japanese hotel hires Mahiru Inoue, a lawyer adept at dealing with the Yakuza, to help them rid their hotel of the local gangsters so they can get a contract for a meeting of important foreign officials."
"In a nameless Chinese city, a mother with her daughter missing, refuses to go gentle into this good night."
This 1987 short horror film by Guillermo del Toro has been personally reworked by the director.
"Written and directed by George Stevens Jr., GEORGE STEVENS: A FILMMAKER’S JOURNEY is a moving portrait of the life and work of one of the greatest Hollywood filmmakers of the twentieth century. From SWING TIME and GUNGA DIN to SHANE and GIANT, George Stevens helped shape American cinema. This 1984 documentary includes interviews with filmmakers Frank Capra and John Huston, actors Cary Grant and Spencer Tracy, and many others."
"As head of the Signal Corps Special Motion Picture Unit in Europe during World War II, Hollywood director George Stevens (A PLACE IN THE SUN, SHANE) oversaw the filming of black-and-white footage that would become a key part of the “official” record of the war as we know it. But he also recorded a personal film diary, shot on Kodachrome, of the events he witnessed, amassing reels of long-unseen color footage that his son, George Stevens Jr., later assembled into this invaluable documentary. Capturing everything from the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the liberation of Paris to the horrors of Dachau and the bombed-out ravages of Berlin, this remarkable slice of history offers a uniquely vivid firsthand look at some of the most consequential moments of the twentieth century."
"Over the course of one hot summer, a group of children in the decaying rural South must confront a tangle of difficult choices. An ambitiously constructed, elegantly photographed meditation on adolescence, the first full-length film by director David Gordon Green features remarkable performances from an award-winning ensemble cast. GEORGE WASHINGTON is a startling and distinct work of contemporary American independent cinema."
"The concluding chapter of Roberto Rossellini’s War Trilogy is the most devastating, a portrait of an obliterated Berlin, seen through the eyes of a twelve-year-old boy. Living in a bombed-out apartment building with his sick father and two older siblings, young Edmund is mostly left to wander unsupervised, getting ensnared in the black-market schemes of a group of teenagers and coming under the nefarious influence of a Nazi-sympathizing ex-teacher. GERMANY YEAR ZERO is a daring, gut-wrenching look at the consequences of fascism, for society and the individual."
"Carl Dreyer’s last film neatly crowns his career: a meditation on tragedy, individual will and the refusal to compromise. A woman leaves her unfulfilling marriage and embarks on a search for ideal love—but neither a passionate affair with a younger man nor the return of an old romance can provide the answer she seeks. Always the stylistic innovator, Dreyer employs long takes and theatrical staging to concentrate on Nina Pens Rode’s sublime portrayal of the proud and courageous Gertrud."
"Told with a delicate blend of satire and nostalgia, this award-winning coming-of-age tale introduces one of Australian literature’s most beloved characters, Laura Tweedle Rambothan (Susannah Fowle), to the screen. Chronicling her stormy passage through the sedate halls of an expensive Melbourne finishing school, this captivating adaptation of the classic best seller by Henry Handel Richardson delivers a rich and amusing portrait of an imaginative country girl who refuses to be broken to fit the mold of a Victorian-era young lady."
"After laying waste to an alien civilization on Venus, the three-headed, lightning-emitting space monster Ghidorah brings its insatiable thirst for destruction to Earth, where fierce foes Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra must join forces in order to deal with the unprecedented threat. An electrifying screen debut for Godzilla’s archenemy Ghidorah, this film also marks a turning point for the series, as the first time the King of the Monsters acts to protect the planet."
"When a centuries-old Scottish castle is deconstucted and moved to Florida to be rebuilt bricky by brick, the new American owners find that the ghost who haunts it (Robert Donat) has made the trip as well!"
A young woman’s quotidian routine—from waking up to going to work to returning home—is enlivened in Joanne Nucho’s 2001 musical.
"Called the greatest rock film ever made, this landmark documentary follows the Rolling Stones on their notorious 1969 U.S. tour. When three hundred thousand members of the Love Generation collided with a few dozen Hells Angels at San Francisco’s Altamont Speedway, Direct Cinema pioneers David and Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin were there to immortalize on film the bloody slash that transformed a decade’s dreams into disillusionment."
"Italy is usually cited as the anchor of the neo-realist movement in cinema, but Mikio Naruse's Ginza Cosmetics (1951) is a reminder that Japan had its own output equally rooted in realism. Set in Tokyo's Ginza district, this low-key, lyrical unassuming account of a few days in the life of a luckless geisha (Kinuyo Tanaka), as she struggles to make a living for herself and her young son, has few dramatic highs or artificial moments, but possesses a startlingly vivid power in its slice-of-life texture."
"A remake of director Oscar Micheaux’s now-lost 1926 silent film THE SPIDER’S WEB, THE GIRL FROM CHICAGO is another film that explores the cultural rift between the urban and the rural, set in both Harlem and Batesburg, Mississippi. As had become his forte, Micheaux punctuates the dramatic scenes with musical numbers."
"Fed up with her abusive family situation, lack of school prospects, and the “boys’ law” in the neighborhood, Marieme starts a new life after meeting a group of three free-spirited girls. She changes her name and her style, drops out of school, and starts stealing to be accepted into the gang. When her home life becomes unbearable, Marieme seeks solace in an older man who promises her money and protection. Realizing this lifestyle will never result in the freedom and independence she truly desires, she finally decides to take matters into her own hands."
A young man who is unable to tell his childhood friend how he feels make a pledge with her to reveal all of their secrets during the upcoming festival. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"A wildly sexy time capsule from the swinging sixties, THE GIRL ON A MOTORCYCLE stars Alain Delon and Marianne Faithfull—two performers at the height of their impressive cool—as lovers with a taste for the open road. Faithfull plays Rebecca, a bored housewife who bolts from her home in the French countryside to visit her lover, Daniel (Delon), in Germany. Wearing nothing but a form-fitting black leather suit (the film was rereleased in the U.S. as NAKED UNDER LEATHER), the lusty Rebecca races across the country, and in flashback remembers the start of their affair. She recalls the initial, furtive glances in her father’s bookstore, her elaborate sexual fantasies, and their long-awaited consummation. Most important of all is the motorcycle itself, a gift from Daniel that seems to give her more pleasure than any man could deliver. Directed by legendary cinematographer Jack Cardiff in pulsating psychedelic hues, THE GIRL ON A MOTORCYCLE has emerged from obscurity to become more than a cult favorite; it is a touchstone film of 1960s Euro youth culture."
"A tailor's apprentice writes a book for young men about wooing women, despite the fact that he himself is nervous around them."
This early short from director Jane Campion concerns a group of teenage girls in the 1960s.
"A young and innocent girl gets romantically involved with an older, married man."
"Agnès Varda’s extraordinary late-career renaissance began with this wonderfully idiosyncratic, self-reflexive documentary in which the French cinema icon explores the world of modern-day gleaners: those living on the margins who survive by foraging for what society throws away. Embracing the intimacy and freedom of digital filmmaking, Varda posits herself as a kind of gleaner of images and ideas, one whose generous, expansive vision makes room for ruminations on everything from aging to the birth of cinema to the beauty of heart-shaped potatoes. By turns playful, philosophical, and subtly political, THE GLEANERS AND I is a warmly human reflection on the contradictions of our consumerist world from an artist who, like her subjects, finds unexpected richness where few think to look."
"Agnès Varda’s charming follow-up to her acclaimed documentary THE GLEANERS AND I is a deceptively unassuming grace note that takes us deeper into the world of those who find purpose and beauty in the refuse of society. Revisiting many of the original film’s subjects to explore the often unexpected effects that their participation in the project has had on their lives, this wonderfully warm and human epilogue once again takes gleaning as the starting point from which to explore what most interests Varda: the richness, complexity, and poignancy of life outside the mainstream. What emerges is a crazy-quilt tapestry of the personal, the political, and the esoteric that celebrates the spirit and creativity of those who forge their own path."
"Intended as one of the final films in the Magellan Calendar, THE DEATH OF MAGELLAN: GLORIA!, made in 1979, was the first work of Hollis Frampton’s to feature a computer. The photographer turned filmmaker was at that time experimenting in the digital arts, an area in which he led courses at the Center for Media Study at the State University of New York at Buffalo."
"The following short film from 1980, featuring director Jean-Luc Godard, was made by Jon Jost, Don Ranvaud, and Peter Wollen, in association with the magazine “Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media.”"
"Hippies and flower children dance and create rituals at the historic Los Angeles “Love-In” of Easter Sunday, 1967."
"In 1979, Louis Malle traveled into the heart of Minnesota to capture the everyday lives of the men and women in a prosperous farming community. Six years later, during Ronald Reagan's second term, he returned to find drastic economic decline. Free of stereotypes about America's ""heartland"" God's Country, commissioned for American public television, is a stunning work of emotional and political clarity."
"Harry Baer plays a newly released ex-convict who slowly but surely finds his way back into the Munich criminal underworld. Meanwhile, his attentions are torn between two women (Hanna Schygulla and Margarethe von Trotta) and the friend (Günther Kaufmann) who shot his brother. This sensual, artfully composed film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is a study of romantic and professional futility."
"GODZILLA (a.k.a. GOJIRA) is the roaring granddaddy of all monster movies. It’s also a remarkably humane and melancholy drama, made in Japan at a time when the country was reeling from nuclear attack and H-bomb testing in the Pacific. Its rampaging radioactive beast, the poignant embodiment of an entire population’s fears, became a beloved international icon of destruction, spawning almost thirty sequels."
"This 1956 feature film, codirected and edited by Terry Morse, is the famous American reworking of the original GODZILLA. It combines footage from the original 1954 production with new material staring Western actors, including Raymond Burr as reporter Steve Martin."
"Toho Studios followed the enormous success of the original Godzilla with this sequel, efficiently directed by Motoyoshi Oda as a straight-ahead monsters-on-the-loose drama. An underrated standout among the Showa Godzilla films, Godzilla Raids Again introduces the monster-versus-monster format that would dominate the remainder of the series, pitting Godzilla against the ferocious, spiny Anguirus as the kaiju wreak havoc in the streets of Osaka in a series of elaborate set pieces that succeed in upping the ante for destruction."
"An alien invasion prompts a tag-team battle between Godzilla and Anguirus, the planet protectors, and King Ghidorah and the new monster Gigan, a cyborg with scythe-like claws, an abdominal buzz saw, winglike back fins, and pincerlike mandibles. In this action-packed film, which veers from the sublime to the ridiculous, the cockroachlike aliens—disguised as humans—use Gigan and King Ghidorah as weapons of conquest in their plot to take over a contaminated Earth."
"Intended to address the crisis levels of pollution in postwar Japan, GODZILLA VS. HEDORAH finds the King of the Monsters fighting an alien life form that arrives on Earth and steadily grows by feeding on industrial waste. Director Yoshimitsu Banno infuses the film with equal parts ecological horror, humorous monster antics, and sixties psychedelia straight out of San Francisco, making for a truly unique—and divisive—entry in the series."
"Godzilla’s evil twin Mechagodzilla first reared its head in this Jun Fukuda–directed film. A robot designed by aliens to conquer Earth, the enduringly popular villain has since been resurrected by Toho Studios several times. With the help of earnest direction, spectacular pyrotechnics, and guest appearances by veteran genre actors, this film recaptures the feel of the sixties Godzilla movies."
"Nuclear testing unleashes mayhem on the undersea kingdom of Seatopia, causing a series of environmental disasters that nearly wipes out Rokuro, the schoolboy protagonist at the center of this film. To exact revenge, Seatopia unleashes Megalon, a gigantic beetle with the ability to fire ray beams and napalm bombs. Meanwhile, Rokuro’s brother creates Jet Jaguar, a flying robot with a built-in moral compass. The inevitable matchup of Godzilla and Jet Jaguar versus Megalon and Gigan decides the world’s fate."
"This mesmerizing, atmospheric samurai tale infuses the genre with a subversive undercurrent of homoerotic frisson. When the young, strikingly handsome Kano Sozaburo (Ryuhei Matsuda) joins an elite samurai unit, his presence unleashes tensions among his fellow swordsmen—including his superior Hijikata Toshizo (Takeshi Kitano)—as they find themselves competing for his affections. The final feature from iconoclastic auteur Nagisa Oshima is a daring, visually sumptuous exploration of the rigid social codes of nineteenth-century Japan."
"After an airplane is forced to crash-land in a remote area, its passengers find themselves face-to-face with an alien force that wants to possess them body and soul, and perhaps take over the entire human race. Filled with creatively repulsive effects, including a very invasive bloblike life-form, Hajime Sato's GOKE, BODY SNATCHER FROM HELL is a pulpy, apocalyptic gross-out."
"Part two of Director Hannu Leminen's account of the Olympic Games Helsinki 1952, with its fierce patriotism and its sense of a nation welcoming the world, is redolent of the period, coming as it did only twelve years after the end of Finland's war with the Soviet Union, and seven years after the end of World War II. Leminen spends GOLD AND GLORY covering non-track-and-field sports, while competitors from across the globe are seen socializing with ease, traversing the language barrier with smiles and gestures, and strengthening the impression of sports as a unifying stimulus for peace."
"A Broadway producer has the talent, the tunes, the theater, and everything else he needs to put on a show—except the dough. Not to worry, say Ginger Rogers and the other leggy chorines decked out in giant coins. Everyone will soon be singing “We’re in the Money.” Soon after 42ND STREET, the brothers Warner again kicked the Depression blues out the stage door and into a back alley. Mervyn Le Roy directs the snappy non-musical portions involving three wonderfully silly love matches (including Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler). And Busby Berkeley brings his peerless magic to the production numbers, his camera swooping and gliding to showstoppers that are naughty (“Pettin’ in the Park”), neon-lit (“The Shadow Waltz”) and soul-searing (“Remember My Forgotten Man”). Solid cinema gold!"
"THE GOLDEN COACH (LE CARROSSE D’OR) is a ravishing eighteenth-century comic fantasy about a viceroy who receives an exquisite golden coach, and gives it to the tempestuous star of a touring commedia dell’arte company. Master director Jean Renoir’s sumptuous tribute to the theater, presented here in the English version he favored, is set to the music of Antonio Vivaldi and built around vivacious and volatile star Anna Magnani."
"After Kanichi's engagement to Miya is broken off by her family so that she can marry a rich suitor, Kanichi heads down a ruthless path to wealth."
"The exuberant enchantments of the singing, dancing musical meet the feminist, formalist sensibility of cinematic visionary Chantal Akerman in this uniquely captivating vision of love and survival in the age of late capitalism. Amid the consumerist wonderland of a shopping mall, a cadre of store employees bounce in and out of one another’s arms in a cycle of breakups, makeups, misunderstandings, and reunions, their romantic roundelay punctuated by imaginatively stylized production numbers. Working with frequent star Delphine Seyrig and a remarkable team of writers—who between them penned everything from JULES AND JIM to DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN—Akerman deftly balances the shiny pop pleasures of the genre with piercing variations on her signature themes, including a startlingly moving reflection on Jewish resilience and the legacy of the Holocaust."
"A killer-for-hire gets mixed up with a cast of wacky characters involved in a gold smuggling route from Beirut to Tokyo. Jun Fukuda directs this follow-up to 100 Shot, 100 Killed (AKA Ironfinger)."
"Charlie Chaplin’s comedic masterwork—which charts a prospector’s search for fortune in the Klondike and his discovery of romance (with the beautiful Georgia Hale)—forever cemented the iconic status of Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Shot partly on location in the Sierra Nevadas and featuring such timeless gags as the dance of the dinner rolls and the meal of boiled shoe leather, THE GOLD RUSH is an indelible work of heartwarming hilarity. "

"Matteo Garrone’s GOMORRAH is a stark, shocking vision of contemporary gangsterdom, and one of cinema’s most authentic depictions of organized crime. In this tour de force adaptation of undercover Italian reporter Roberto Saviano’s best-selling exposé of Naples’ Mafia underworld (known as the Camorra), Garrone links five disparate tales in which men and children are caught up in a corrupt system that extends from the housing projects to the world of haute couture. Filmed with an exquisite detachment interrupted by bursts of violence, GOMORRAH is a shattering, socially engaged true-crime story from a major new voice in Italian cinema."
A lancer falls into disgrace when his social ambitions lead him to become engaged to two different women. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda.
"Fifteen-year-old Camille (Lola Créton) is a serious girl who has fallen in love with the cheerful Sullivan (Sebastian Urzendowsky), an older boy who returns her feelings, mostly, but wants to be free to explore the world. When he leaves her to travel, she is devastated, but develops over the following years into a more fully formed woman, with new interests and a new love—and the possibility that she’ll be less defenseless when Sullivan enters her life again. Mia Hansen-Løve’s achingly tender portrait of teenage heartbreak showcases her extraordinary ability to craft a story familiar in its broad strokes yet so personal and specific that it feels utterly singular."
Two journalists and their lovers share an uncertain future. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"After she flees the scene of a hit-and-run accident, a woman finds herself caught in a surreal spiral of guilt and paranoia in this unsettling stop-motion nerve-shredder."
"A lighthearted take on director Yasujiro Ozu’s perennial theme of the challenges of inter­generational relationships, GOOD MORNING tells the story of two young boys who stop speaking in protest after their parents refuse to buy a television set. Ozu weaves a wealth of subtle gags through a family portrait as rich as those of his dramatic films, mocking the foibles of the adult world through the eyes of his child protagonists. Shot in stunning color and set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new washing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door salesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I WAS BORN, BUT . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan."
"From late splatter-movie master Herschell Gordon Lewis, who brought you the infamous “video nasty” BLOOD FEAST, his appropriately-titled THE GORE GORE GIRLS is perhaps his grisliest, most outrageous offering of all time! A vicious killer with a twisted sense of humor is butchering the girls of a go-go dancing club. As the death toll mounts, young reporter Nancy Weston teams up with obnoxious but dapper private investigator Abraham Gentry to try and crack the case. Nipples are snipped, faces are fried, and asses are tenderized as THE GORE GORE GIRLS hurtles toward its shocking (and hilarious) conclusion."
"Maurice Pialat’s oft-overlooked chronicle of jaded adolescence unfolds in a small town in northern France where a group of teenagers stave off boredom and the looming responsibilities of adulthood by losing themselves in a reckless cycle of sex, drugs, and rebellion. Something of a companion to Pialat’s first feature, L’ENFANCE NUE, GRADUATE FIRST once again finds the director training his unflinching gaze on the dead-end youth of France with a heightened vérité immediacy that’s realer than realism."
"Despite having a loving and patient wife at home, a good-natured suit-and-tie man, played by writer-director Pierre Etaix, finds himself hopelessly attracted to his gorgeous new secretary in this gently satirical tale of temptation. From this simple, standard premise, Etaix weaves a constantly surprising web of complexly conceived jokes. LE GRAND AMOUR is a cutting, nearly Buñuelian takedown of the bourgeoisie that somehow doesn’t have a mean bone in its body."
"Les Grandes Manoeuvres is a wonderfully autumnal work from Rene Clair -- it was also his first film in color, and he uses the production design and the story, coupled with the range of available hues to impart a dreamlike quality to plot, a romantic escapade by a vain military officer on the eve of World War I. Michele Morgan (Passage To Marseilles, The Chase) is the object of Gerard Phillipe's affections in this wistful tale of a world and an era gone by."
A boy plants a seed that grows into a grandmother in this experimental short film.
"THE GRAND OLYMPICS, the first Olympic film to be nominated for an Academy Award, celebrates the architecture and atmosphere of Rome while utilizing telephoto lenses to bring the action closer to the audience than ever before."
"One of the great raconteurs of stage and screen, Spalding Gray, came together with one of cinema's boldest image-makers, Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh, for Gray's Anatomy, a spellbinding adaptation of Gray's 1993 monologue of the same name (cowritten with Renée Shafransky). In it, Gray, with typical sardonic relish, chronicles his arduous journey through the diagnosis and treatment of a rare and alarming ocular condition. For the monologist, this experience occasioned a meditation on illness and mortality, medicine and metaphysics; for the filmmaker, it was a chance to experiment with ways of bringing his subject's words to brilliant, eye-opening life."
"For decades, journalist Jep Gambardella has charmed and seduced his way through the glittering nightlife of Rome. Since the legendary success of his only novel, he has been a permanent fixture in the city’s literary and elite social circles. But on his sixty-fifth birthday, Jep unexpectedly finds himself taking stock of his life, turning his cutting wit on himself and his contemporaries, and looking past the lavish nightclubs, parties, and cafés to find Rome itself, in all its monumental glory: a timeless landscape of absurd, exquisite beauty. Featuring sensuous cinematography, a lush score, and an award-winning central performance by the great Toni Servillo, this transporting experience by the brilliant Italian director Paolo Sorrentino is a breathtaking Felliniesque tale of decadence and lost love."
"In his controversial masterpiece THE GREAT DICTATOR, Charlie Chaplin offers both a cutting caricature of Adolf Hitler and a sly tweaking of his own comic persona. Chaplin, in his first pure talkie, brings his sublime physicality to two roles: the cruel yet clownish “Tomainian” dictator and the kindly Jewish barber who is mistaken for him. Featuring Jack Oakie and Paulette Goddard in stellar supporting turns, THE GREAT DICTATOR, boldly going after the fascist leader before the U.S.’s official entry into World War II, is an audacious amalgam of politics and slapstick that culminates in Chaplin’s famously impassioned speech."
"One of the great translations of literature into film, David Lean’s GREAT EXPECTATIONS brings Charles Dickens’s masterpiece to robust on-screen life. Pip, Magwitch, Miss Havisham, and Estella populate Lean’s magnificent miniature, beautifully photographed by Guy Green and designed by John Bryan."
"In the midst of Nazi air raids, a postman dies on the operating table at a rural English hospital. But was the death accidental? A delightful and wholly unexpected murder mystery, British writer/director Sidney Gilliat’s GREEN FOR DANGER features Trevor Howard and Sally Gray as suspected doctors and Alastair Sim in a marvelous turn as Scotland Yard’s insouciant Inspector Cockrill. A screenwriter who had worked with Hitchcock on such films as THE LADY VANISHES and JAMAICA INN, Gilliat slyly upends whodunit conventions with wit and style."
"The British film industry was in deep trouble in the late 1940s, sufficient to justify the craft unions themselves working to secure some production for their members -- one result was Green Grow The Rushes (1951), a comedy directed by Derek Twist and starring Richard Burton, Roger Livesey (The Life And Death of Colonel Blimp, I Know Where I'm Going), and Honor Blackman (Goldfinger, The Avengers, A Night To Remember). The plot is a piercing look at postwar Britain, and efforts to move the nation into the modern age -- that doesn't sit well with the people of Anderia Marsh, who have claimed a right (going back to Henry III) to evade government-imposed import duties and taxes. And when the government decides to curb this right, the whole village quietly rises up in a comical rebellion."
"While on summer vacation, a lonely woman attempts to deal with her personal feelings of isolation."
"Playing herself, Cheryl Dunye humorously experiences the mysteries of lesbian dating in the 1990s."
"An awkward, paraplegic man (Michael Cera) goes looking for love in this daringly oddball comic nightmare, winner of the Sundance short-film jury prize."
"Meet Big and Little Edie Beale: mother and daughter, high-society dropouts, and reclusive cousins of Jackie Onassis. The two manage to thrive together amid the decay and disorder of their East Hampton, New York, mansion, making for an eerily ramshackle echo of the American Camelot. An impossibly intimate portrait, this 1976 documentary by Albert and David Maysles, codirected by Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer, quickly became a cult classic and established Little Edie as a fashion icon and philosopher queen."
"Hailed by Susan Sontag (“One of those painful experiences that’s good for you”), Gloria Steinem (“A true and piercing look at American womanhood”), and Elizabeth Hardwick (“In its unadorned truthfulness there is a sad and simple poetry, and a lesson about the lives of all of us”), Julia Reichert and Jim Klein’s GROWING UP FEMALE is s a touchstone of 1970s feminism, illuminating the forces that shaped the lives and self-images of six girls and women."
"After dabbling in the unlikely world of children’s entertainment with JIMMY, THE BOY WONDER and THE MAGIC LAND OF MOTHER GOOSE, “Godfather of Gore” Herschell Gordon Lewis returned to genre he helped create with the delightfully depraved THE GRUESOME TWOSOME. The young women of a small-town American college have more than just split ends to worry about. Down at the Little Wig Shop, the batty Mrs. Pringle and her socially inept son Rodney are procuring only the finest heads of hair—by scalping the local coeds! Can they be stopped before they clear the entire campus of luxuriant-haired ladies?"
Bill Plympton’s Oscar-nominated short at last answers the eternal question: why do dogs bark at such innocent creatures as pigeons and squirrels? Just what are they afraid of?
"Through single-reel portraits, Vivienne Dick captures the lives of New York No Wave icons, including Pat Place and Lydia Lunch."
"This twisted sequel to the Oscar-nominated GUARD DOG details the continuing adventures of an eager canine. This time he takes a job helping the blind, but still leaves a path of destruction in his wake."
"Bart Tare (John Dall) has been enamored with firearms since he was a kid. Annie Laurie Star (Peggy Cummins) is the sharp-shooting queen of a traveling carnival. When Bart beats Laurie in a sexually charged shooting contest, it quickly leads to love, marriage, and a wild crime spree as the couple embark on a string of dangerous bank heists, living life and facing death on their own terms. Joseph H. Lewis directs this benchmark film noir in dizzying, dazzling style, employing innovative camera work and daring innuendo to create what may just be the ultimate example of B-movie poetry."
"Mathieu Kassovitz took the film world by storm with LA HAINE, a gritty, unsettling, and visually explosive look at the racial and cultural volatility in modern-day France, specifically the low-income banlieue districts on Paris’s outskirts. Aimlessly passing their days in the concrete environs of their dead-end suburbia, Vinz (Vincent Cassel), Hubert (Hubert Koundé), and Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui), a Jew, an African, and an Arab, give human faces to France’s immigrant populations, their bristling resentment at their marginalization slowly simmering until it reaches a climactic boiling point. A work of tough beauty, LA HAINE is a landmark of contemporary French cinema and a gripping reflection of its country’s ongoing identity crisis."
"Yussuf Mume Saleh journeys nightly into the outskirts of the walled city of Harar to bond with his beloved hyenas, a ritual he has practiced for over thirty-five years. Shot in black and white, HAIRAT is a meditation on this uniquely symbiotic relationship between man and wild beast."
"Bill Plympton spoofs the teen movies of a bygone era in this gothic, 1950s-set high school comedy about a love triangle that goes terribly wrong as two murdered students return to their prom to get revenge. Filtering elements of GREASE, CARRIE, and early rock ’n’ roll heartbreak ballads through his singularly bizarro sensibility, Plympton crafts a darkly demented satire that features the voice talents of Sarah Silverman, Dermot Mulroney, Michael Showalter, Matt Groening, Ed Begley Jr., Beverly D’Angelo, David and Keith Carradine, and more."
"One of Jackie Chan’s first forays into the kung-fu comedy style that would become his signature is an unabashedly silly historical adventure in which he plays a hapless student who assumes the identity of a dead martial-arts master and is launched on a treacherous quest to retrieve a sacred jade plant. Released just months before DRUNKEN MASTER would launch him to superstardom, HALF A LOAF OF KUNG FU finds Chan spoofing the conventions of the typical Hong Kong martial-arts movie to hilarious effect."
This early short by Jaromil Jireš anticipates the formal and stylistic experimentation that would characterize VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS.
The following is a short film created in 2014 by director Guy Maddin.
"Winner of four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, Sir Laurence Olivier’s HAMLET continues to be the most compelling version of Shakespeare’s beloved tragedy. Olivier is at his most inspired—both as director and as the melancholy Dane himself—as he breathes new life into the words of one of the world’s greatest dramatists."
"Director Im Kwon-taek roots his idiosyncratic Olympic documentary, HAND IN HAND, in the past, with opening shots of the barbed wire dividing South from North Korea and an Australian veteran recalling the conflict of the early fifties. Im brings a true auteur's sensibility to his documentary. He heightens certain sounds, such as the crash of swimmers entering the water or the thump of a diving platform. The cheers of the crowds are subservient to the music, but, when ushered in by Im, the applause is all the more energizing, like the thunder of waves on the shore."
"Adapted by Harold Pinter from the landmark novel by Margaret Atwood, the original screen adaptation of THE HANDMAID’S TALE takes place in an authoritarian future America where young, healthy women must serve the country by giving birth to babies for an increasingly infertile society determined to produce a more “pure” generation. When she is forced to become a childbearing “handmaiden” for the wealthy Commander (Robert Duvall) and his wife (Faye Dunaway), Offred (Natasha Richardson) launches a rebellion to reclaim her autonomy."
"Rod Steiger is ferocious as a scheming land developer in Francesco Rosi’s HANDS OVER THE CITY, a blistering work of social realism and the winner of the 1963 Venice Film Festival Golden Lion. This expose of the politically driven real-estate speculation that has devastated Naples’s civilian landscape moves breathlessly from a cataclysmic building collapse to the backroom negotiations of civic leaders vying for power in a city council election, laying bare the inner workings of corruption with passion and outrage."
"Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami (Shintaro Katsu), incorruptible protector of the common man, must track down an infamous killer who has escaped from prison."
"Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami (Shintaro Katsu), incorruptible protector of the common man, returns in his second and even more perverse mystery."
"Orgying blind high priests, desperate royal wives, corruption, and conspiracy are all part of the mystery Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami (Shintaro Katsu) uncovers at the Shogunate treasury in the rousing climax of the Razor trilogy."
A young woman waits and waits for her delayed husband to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
"Yiu-Fai and Po-Wing go on vacation to Argentina together, where their relationship and lives start to fall apart as emotions settle in."
"Following the collapse of his clan, an unemployed samurai (Tatsuya Nakadai) arrives at the manor of Lord Iyi, begging to be allowed to commit ritual suicide on the property. Iyi’s clansmen, believing the desperate ronin is merely angling for a new position, try to force his hand and get him to eviscerate himself, but they have underestimated his beliefs and his personal brand of honor. Winner of the Cannes Film Festival’s Special Jury Prize, HARAKIRI, directed by Masaki Kobayashi, is a fierce evocation of individual agency in the face of a corrupt and hypocritical system."
"Meet the Beatles! Just one month after they exploded onto the U.S. scene with their Ed Sullivan Show appearance, John, Paul, George, and Ringo began working on a project that would bring their revolutionary talent to the big screen. A HARD DAY’S NIGHT, in which the bandmates play cheeky comic versions of themselves, captured the astonishing moment when they officially became the singular, irreverent idols of their generation and changed music forever. Directed with raucous, anything-goes verve by Richard Lester and featuring a slew of iconic pop anthems, including the title track, “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “I Should Have Known Better,” and “If I Fell,” A HARD DAY’S NIGHT, which reconceived the movie musical and exerted an incalculable influence on the music video, is one of the most deliriously entertaining movies of all time."
"Barbara Kopple’s Academy Award-winning HARLAN COUNTY USA unflinchingly documents a grueling coal miners’ strike in a small Kentucky town. With unprecedented access, Kopple and her crew captured the miners’ sometimes violent struggles with strikebreakers, local police, and company thugs. Featuring a haunting soundtrack, with legendary country and bluegrass artists Hazel Dickens, Merle Travis, Sarah Gunning, and Florence Reece, the film is a heartbreaking record of the thirteen-month struggle between a community fighting to survive and a corporation dedicated to the bottom line."
"Nineteenth-century English author James Rankin (Boris Karloff) believes that the wrong man was hanged twenty years earlier for a series of murders, but his investigations lead him to a horrible and, for him, gruesomely inescapable secret."
"In this warmhearted comic yarn from Aki Kaurismäki, fate throws the young African refugee Idrissa (Blondin Miguel) into the path of Marcel Marx (André Wilms), a kindly old bohemian who shines shoes for a living in the French harbor city Le Havre. With inborn optimism and the support of his tight-knit community, Marcel stands up to the officials doggedly pursuing the boy for deportation. A political fairy tale that exists somewhere between the reality of contemporary France and the classic French cinema of the past, LE HAVRE is a charming, deadpan delight and one of the Finnish director’s finest films."
Ximena Cuevas dissects an upper-class wedding in Mexico City where the guests fantasize about the exotic faraway dreamscape that is their “Hawai.”
"Grave robbing, torture, possessed nuns, and a satanic Sabbath: Benjamin Christensen’s legendary silent film uses a series of dramatic vignettes to explore the scientific hypothesis that the witches of the Middle Ages and early modern era suffered from the same ills as psychiatric patients diagnosed with hysteria in the film's own time. Far from a dry dissertation on the topic, the film itself is a witches’ brew of the scary, the gross, and the darkly humorous. Christensen’s mix-and-match approach to genre anticipates gothic horror, documentary re-creation, and the essay film, making for an experience unlike anything else in the history of cinema."
"A bourgeois middle-aged dentist named Verónica (María Onetto) drives alone on a dirt road, becomes distracted, and runs over something. Immediately she becomes disoriented, unmoored from her identity and reality, like a sleepwalker who’s actually awake. As the week goes on, she becomes obsessed with the possibility that she may have killed someone: a young boy whose body is found in a roadside canal. Veronica tries to piece together what happened while her husband systematically erases her tracks. A chilling parable about a woman in shock, Lucrecia Martel’s brilliant third feature explores the intricacies of class and the role of women in a male-dominated society."
"HEART OF A DOG marks the first feature film in thirty years by multimedia artist Laurie Anderson. A cinematic tone poem that flows from a sustained meditation on death and other forms of absence, the film seamlessly weaves together thoughts on Tibetan Buddhism, reincarnation, the modern surveillance state, and the artistic lives of dogs, with an elegy for the filmmaker's beloved rat terrier, Lolabelle, at its heart. Narrated by Anderson with her characteristic wry wit, and featuring a plaintive, free-form score by the filmmaker, the tender and provocative HEART OF A DOG continues Anderson's four-and-a-half-decade career of imbuing the everyday with a sense of dreamlike wonder."
"A startling and courageous film, Peter Davis’s landmark 1974 documentary HEARTS AND MINDS unflinchingly confronted the United States’ involvement in Vietnam at the height of the controversy that surrounded it. Using a wealth of sources—from interviews to newsreels to footage of the conflict and the upheaval it occasioned on the home front—Davis constructs a powerfully affecting picture of the disastrous effects of war. Explosive, persuasive, and wrenching, HEARTS AND MINDS is an overwhelming emotional experience and the most important nonfiction film ever made about this devastating period in history."
"A woman follows in her late father's footsteps and becomes a gambler, only to meet her father's murderer at a game."
"Presented here are the only identified fragments of James and Eloyce Gist’s little-known follow-up to HELL-BOUND TRAIN: HEAVEN-BOUND TRAVELERS. A man wrongfully accuses his wife (Eloyce Gist) of adultery and banishes her (and their daughter) from his house. But as the weeks pass, he struggles with his own faith and ultimately finds an opportunity for redemption."
Directed by Nathan Kroll • 1962 • United States
"Directed with a keen sense of ambiguity by William Wyler, this film based on a hit stage adaptation of Henry James’s “Washington Square” pivots on a question of motive. When shy, emotionally fragile Catherine Sloper (Olivia de Havilland, in a heartbreaking, Oscar-winning turn), the daughter of a wealthy New York doctor, begins to receive calls from the handsome spendthrift Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift), she becomes possessed by the promise of romance. Are his smoldering professions of love sincere, as she believes they are? Or is Catherine’s calculating father (Ralph Richardson) correct in judging Morris a venal fortune seeker? A graceful drawing-room drama boasting Academy Award–winning costume design by Edith Head, THE HEIRESS is also a piercing character study riven by emotional uncertainty and lacerating cruelty, in a triumph of classic Hollywood filmmaking at its most psychologically nuanced."
"HELL-BOUND TRAIN is arguably the most significant rediscovery in Pioneers of African American Cinema. The film is the work of self-taught filmmakers James and Eloyce Gist, African American evangelists who employed cinema as a tool for their traveling ministry. Their surreal visual allegories were screened in churches and meeting halls, accompanied by a sermon and the passing of a collection plate. Rather than having a linear story, the film is instead a catalog of iniquity, a car-by-car dramatization of the sins of the Jazz Age (including gambling, dancing, alcohol, and the mistreatment of animals), presided over by a horned devil and culminating in a colossal derailment (a model train tossed into a bonfire). Admittedly, the production values are minimal—shot with handheld 16 mm equipment using natural light, sans audio—but the surreality of it all makes for a compelling viewing experience, and shows that renegade, visionary filmmakers can be found in the most unexpected places. HELL-BOUND TRAIN is presented here with a score by Dr. Samuel Waymon, best known to cineastes as having provided the moody soundtrack for Bill Gunn’s influential 1973 film GANJA AND HESS. It is believed that HELL-BOUND TRAIN was filmed prior to James’s marriage to Eloyce, so it is unclear how much involvement she had in the making of the film. But she may have had a hand in the editing and was certainly engaged in all aspects of their subsequent work."
"When a soldier returns home at the end of World War II, he refuses to forgive his wife for prostituting herself one night in order to pay off medical bills after their son's sudden illness."
"One of contemporary cinema’s most sensitive coming-out films, Stephen Cone’s follow-up to his acclaimed breakout feature THE WISE KIDS unfolds over the course of one very eventful day in the life of seventeen-year-old preacher’s kid Henry (Cole Doman). At Henry’s afternoon birthday pool party, the guests include an assortment of adults from the family church as well as Henry’s secular and religious teen friends, among them the closeted Logan (Daniel Kyri) who clearly has eyes for Henry. As Henry moves among various romantic possibilities, so too do the party’s adults and teenagers, all of them struggling to navigate the public and private and to reconcile their faith with their physical desires."
"Olivier mustered out of the navy to film this adaptation of Shakespeare’s history. Embroiled in World War II, Britons took courage from this tale of a king who surmounts overwhelming odds and emerges victorious. This sumptuous Technicolor rendering features a thrilling re-creation of the battle of Agincourt, and Sir Laurence in his prime as director and actor."
Kon Ichikawa's family drama focuses on the relationship between a pair of siblings in 1920's Japan.
"This mesmerizing debut by the great Swedish director Jan Troell is an epic bildungsroman and a multilayered representation of early twentieth-century Sweden. Based on a series of autobiographical novels by Nobel Prize winner Eyvind Johnson, HERE IS YOUR LIFE follows a working-class boy’s development, from naive teenager to intellectually curious young adult, from logger to movie projectionist to politically engaged man of the people—all set against the backdrop of a slowly industrializing rural landscape. With its mix of modernist visual ingenuity and elegantly structured storytelling, this enchanting film—presented here in its original nearly three-hour cut—is a reminder that Troell is one of European cinema’s finest and most sensitive illuminators of the human condition."
A young woman from a wealthy family that has fallen on hard times seeks out the president of a car factory for a husband.
"In this psychologically rich character study, written and directed by Satyajit Ray, Bengali film star Uttam Kumar draws on his real-world celebrity to play Arindam Mukherjee, a matinee idol on the brink of his first flop. When Mukherjee boards an overnight train to Delhi to accept an award, a journalist (Sharmila Tagore) approaches him seeking an exclusive interview, which initiates a conversation that sends the actor reeling down a path of self-examination. Seamlessly integrating rueful flashbacks and surreal dream sequences with the quietly revelatory stories of the train’s other passengers, THE HERO is a graceful meditation on art, fame, and regret from one of world cinema’s most keenly perceptive filmmakers."
"For their final screen pairing, Joan Blondell and James Cagney left behind the lighthearted comedy of their six earlier outings together for a decidedly darker tale of crime and doomed romance. Made during the waning days of the pre-Code era, HE WAS HER MAN casts Cagney as Flicker Hayes, a mobster recently sprung from jail with two hit men on his tail, who joins up with Rose (Blondell), a destitute ex–sex worker also in dire straits. Together, the desperate pair hide out in a small fishing village and wait for fate to catch up with them."
"In this melodrama by Raffaello Matarazzo, a young woman is mistakenly imprisoned for her sister's crime of abandoning her own child. When her husband finds out while working abroad, he decides to nullify their marriage."
"A grand-scale adventure as only Akira Kurosawa could make one, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS stars the inimitable Toshiro Mifune as a general charged with guarding his defeated clan’s princess (a fierce Misa Uehara) as the two smuggle royal treasure across hostile territory. Accompanying them are a pair of bumbling, conniving peasants who may or may not be their friends. This rip-roaring ride is among the director’s most beloved films and was a primary influence on George Lucas’s STAR WARS. THE HIDDEN FORTRESS delivers Kurosawa’s trademark deft blend of wry humor, breathtaking action, and compassionate humanity."
"In this silent film, a young man gets drunk by accident then winds up on a narrow ledge high above the street."
"Toshiro Mifune is unforgettable as Kingo Gondo, a wealthy industrialist whose family becomes the target of a cold-blooded kidnapper in HIGH AND LOW (TENGOKU TO JIGOKU), the highly influential domestic drama and police procedural from director Akira Kurosawa. Adapting Ed McBain’s detective novel “King’s Ransom,” Kurosawa moves effortlessly from compelling race-against-time thriller to exacting social commentary, creating a diabolical treatise on contemporary Japanese society."
"Pedro Almodóvar’s outré homage to the classic mother-daughter melodrama traces the fraught relationship between a flamboyant actress (Marisa Paredes) and her estranged daughter (Victoria Abril) who become embroiled in a murder case when a man with whom they were each romantically involved is killed. Delighting in the lurid mechanics of the twist-filled plot, Almodóvar crafts a stylish, witty, gender-bending soap opera in the tradition of Sirk and Fassbinder."
"Slice-of-life look at a sweet working-class couple in London, Shirley and Cyril, his mother, who's aging quickly and becoming forgetful, mum's ghastly upper-middle-class neighbors, and Cyril's pretentious sister and philandering husband. Shirley wants a baby, but Cyril, who reads Marx and wants the world to be perfect, is reluctant. Cyril's mum locks herself out and must ask her snooty neighbors for help. Then Cyril's sister Valerie stages a surprise party for mum's 70th birthday, a disaster from start to finish. Shirley holds things together, and she and Cyril may put aside her Dutch cap after all."
The myth of the Sun Goddess who founded Japanese society is seen through the lens of a modern view of history. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda.
"A cornerstone of the French New Wave, the first feature from Alain Resnais is one of the most influential films of all time. A French actress (Emmanuelle Riva) and a Japanese architect (Eiji Okada) engage in a brief, intense affair in postwar Hiroshima, their consuming mutual fascination impelling them to exorcise their own scarred memories of love and suffering. With an innovative flashback structure and an Academy Award–nominated screenplay by novelist Marguerite Duras, HIROSHIMA MON AMOUR is a moody masterwork that delicately weaves past and present, personal pain and public anguish."
"Harold Lloyd plays a tireless American bookseller traveling abroad in the kingdom of Thermosa, where he is mistaken for a prince. When the true prince returns to stake his claim to the throne, the country is thrown into turmoil."
"Chantal Akerman explores Jewish American identity in this multilayered portrait of the immigrant experience. Shot in Brooklyn near the Williamsburg Bridge, HISTOIRES D’AMÉRIQUE takes the form of a series of first-person addresses delivered by a cross-section of Jewish New Yorkers (including Living Theatre cofounder Judith Malina), whose by turns tragic and humorous tales speak to a collective history of trauma, displacement, and resilience."
"Jean Arthur plays a married woman who falls in love with a French headwaiter, much to the chagrin of her possessive and jealous husband."
"Terence Stamp is Willie, a gangster’s henchman turned “supergrass” (informer) trying to live in peaceful hiding in a remote Spanish village. Sun-dappled bliss turns to nerve-racking suspense, however, when two hit men—played by a soulless John Hurt and a youthful, loose-cannon Tim Roth—come a-calling to bring Willie back for execution. This stylish early gem from Stephen Frears boasts terrific performances from a roster of England’s best hard-boiled actors, music by Eric Clapton and virtuoso flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía, and ravishing photography of its desolate Spanish locations—a splendid backdrop for a rather sordid story."
"This song-filled short features a medley of standards by composer Hoagy Carmichael, including “Washboard Blues,” “Old Rockin’ Chair,” and his signature song, “Stardust,” performed by trombonist Jack Teagarden and his orchestra."
"An unsung comic triumph from David Lean, HOBSON’S CHOICE stars the legendary Charles Laughton as the harrumphing Henry Hobson, the owner of a boot shop in late Victorian northern England. With his haughty, independent daughter Maggie (Brenda De Banzie) decides to forge her own path, romantically and professionally, with none other than Henry’s prized bootsmith Will (a splendid John Mills), father and daughter find themselves head-to-head in a fiery match of wills. Equally charming and caustic, HOBSON’S CHOICE, adapted from Harold Brighouse’s famous play, is filled to the brim with great performances and elegant, inventive camera work."
"For this runaway success of urban guerrilla filmmaking, director Robert Townsend and Keenen Ivory Wayans teamed up both as screenwriters and stars in what Janet Maslin of the “New York Times” called an “exuberant, tirelessly energetic, funny, appealingly mean-spirited, and easy-to-like” comedy. Townsend is actor wannabe Bobby Taylor, who dreams of landing a role, but faces pigeonholing as a jive-talkin’ gangsta. Bobby ultimately realizes that the best parts are inside his head as HOLLYWOOD SHUFFLE spoofs everything from Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” to Siskel & Ebert."
"After the death of his wife, Gurupada and his daughter fall in with a holy man who wows them with memories of meeting Plato, teaching Einstein, being present at the Crucifixion and on first-name terms with the Buddha in this social satire from Satyajit Ray."
"Both a romantic-triangle tale and a philosophical take on violence in times of revolution, The Home and the World, set in early twentieth-century Bengal, concerns an aristocratic but progressive man who, in insisting on broadening his more traditional wife's political horizons, drives her into the arms of his radical school chum. Satyajit Ray had wanted to adapt Rabindranath Tagore's classic novel to the screen for decades. When he finally did in 1984, he fashioned a personal, exquisite film that stands as a testament to his lifelong love for the great writer."
"In Abbas Kiarostami’s second documentary feature about education, the filmmaker himself asks the questions, probing a succession of invariably cute first- and second-graders about their home situations and the schoolwork they must do there. It emerges that many parents are illiterate. Tellingly, many kids can define punishment (the corporal variety seems common) but not encouragement."
"In David Mamet’s cinema, nothing is as it seems—so you better know what you’re looking for. Unfortunately, the protagonist of Mamet’s nightmarish urban odyssey HOMICIDE, inner-city police detective Bobby Gold (Joe Mantegna), is as bewildered about who he is as who (or what) he’s after. Gold’s investigation, following the murder of an elderly Jewish candy-shop owner, leads him down a path of obscure encounters and clues, to a profound reckoning with his own identity. Filled with Mamet’s trademark verbal play and featuring standout supporting performances from William H. Macy, Ving Rhames, and Rebecca Pidgeon, HOMICIDE is a taut, rich work from a true American original."
"Martha Beck (Shirley Stoler) is sullen, overweight, and lonely. Desperate for affection, she joins Aunt Carrie’s Friendship Club and strikes up a correspondence with Ray Fernandez (Tony Lo Bianco), a charismatic smooth talker who could be the man of her dreams—or a degenerate con artist. Based on a shocking true story and shot in documentary-style black and white by the confident and inspired Leonard Kastle, in what would be his only foray into filmmaking, THE HONEYMOON KILLERS is a stark portrayal of the desperate lengths to which a lonely heart will go to find true love."
"Before TINY FURNITURE, director Lena Dunham made a number of short films, one of which is presented here."
"The inimitable comic team of Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson star in this nimble tale of international intrigue from master British filmmaker Ronald Neame. Based on Brian Garfield’s best-selling novel, the blithe thriller centers on Miles Kendig (Matthau), a disillusioned retired CIA agent who, with the help of a chic and savvy Viennese widow (Jackson), threatens to publish his memoirs and expose the innermost secrets of every major intelligence agency in the world. Despite being in major hot water with his former colleagues, Kendig refuses to get in line—he’s having too much fun. Set to the sounds of Mozart, this lighthearted sendup of the paranoid dramas of its era is an expertly crafted, singular take on the spy movie."
"Jacques Demy makes a rare on-screen appearance as the star of LES HORIZONS MORTS, his debut dramatic short from 1951, about a young man suffering from a broken heart."
"In the fourth film in Bill Plympton’s GUARD DOG series, our plucky canine friend fends off an obese dog, attacking oysters, and a killer violin bow, all while trying to win the love of his heart’s desire."
This short film covers the equestrian segment of the 1956 Summer Olympics.
"In Ronald Neame’s film of Joyce Cary’s classic novel, Alec Guinness transforms himself into one of cinema’s most indelible comic figures: the lovably scruffy painter Gulley Jimson. As the ill-behaved Jimson searches for a perfect canvas, he determines to let nothing come between himself and the realization of his exalted vision. A perceptive examination of the struggle of artistic creation, THE HORSE’S MOUTH is also Neame’s comic masterpiece."
"A young boy keeps a horse company during its last moments of life in Charles Burnett’s spare, lyrical student film, which poignantly contrasts the callousness of adults with the empathy of children.
"
"Krzysztof Kieślowski began his career making documentaries. Presented here is HOSPITAL, one of his nonfiction shorts."
"Virtually unseen for more than eighty years, Spencer Williams’s first film is a one-reel comedy short in which a rivalry between two men is played out in a high-stakes game of mini golf."
"The indomitable canine hero of Bill Plympton’s GUARD DOG series joins a fire department to save the world and gain the affection he so richly deserves. However, the results never turn out the way he plans."
"Hotel Du Nord isn't as well known as the two movies Marcel Carné made before and after, Port Of Shadows and Le Jour Se Lève. But any Carné, especially pre-war Carné (and doubly so with Arletty in the cast), is worth seeing. Annabella is the star of this drama, about a star-crossed couple, betrayal, and redemption involving a procuror (Louis Jouvet) who is profoundly affected by her innocence."
"Under Chantal Akerman's watchful eye, a cheap Manhattan hotel glows with mystery and unexpected beauty, its corridors, elevators, rooms, windows, and occasional occupants framed like Edward Hopper tableaux."
"A companion piece to DRY WOOD that was filmed simultaneously, this is an energetic portrait of the Grammy-winning Creole musician Clifton Chenier, a.k.a. the King of Zydeco. HOT PEPPER brings viewers into the Louisiana juke joints where Chenier plays his unique music, which synthesizes elements of traditional Cajun dance tunes and black R&B with African-inflected percussion. Chenier’s accordion-driven rhythms and sophisticated melodies are unforgettably catchy, and Les Blank beautifully captures the music’s propulsive, foot-tapping joy on film."
"Johan Borg (Max Von Sydow), an artists battling repressed desires, starts to lose his grip on reality while vacationing on a remote Scandinavian island with his wife Alma (Liv Ulmann)."
"The powerhouse trio of Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman deliver masterful performances in Stephen Daldry’s exquisitely multilayered adaptation of Michael Cunningham’s Pulitzer Prize–winning novel. Set across a span of eight decades, THE HOURS tells the stories of three women in different times, related by subtle parallels in their personal lives. Present-day New Yorker Clarissa (Streep) throws a party for a writer friend suffering from AIDS. Laura (Moore), living in 1949 Los Angeles, quietly suffers under the constraints of being a wife and mother. Virginia Woolf (an Oscar-winning Kidman), writes one of her greatest works, MRS. DALLOWAY, while grappling with depression. Each faces a profound internal crisis that brings her to the existential edge."
"How to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi’s indescribable 1977 movie HOUSE (HAUSU)? As a psychedelic ghost tale? A stream-of-consciousness bedtime story? An episode of “Scooby-Doo” as directed by Mario Bava? Any of the above will do for this hallucinatory head trip about a schoolgirl who travels with six classmates to her ailing aunt’s creaky country home and comes face-to-face with evil spirits, a demonic house cat, a bloodthirsty piano, and other ghoulish visions, all realized by Obayashi via mattes, animation, and collage effects. Equally absurd and nightmarish, HOUSE might have been beamed to Earth from some other planet. Never before available on home video in the United States, it’s one of the most exciting cult discoveries in years."
"A torrent of sexual obsession, revenge, and betrayal is unleashed under one roof in this venomous melodrama from South Korean master Kim Ki-young. Immensely popular in its home country when it was released, THE HOUSEMAID is the thrilling, at times jaw-dropping story of the devastating effect an unstable housemaid has on the domestic cocoon of a bourgeois, morally dubious music teacher, his devoted wife, and their precocious young children. Grim and taut yet perched on the border of the absurd, Kim’s film is an engrossing tale of class warfare and familial disintegration that has been hugely influential on the new generation of South Korean filmmakers."
"Through a combination of underwater, time-lapse, and microscopic photography, Jean Painlevé creates a beautiful study of the reproduction cycle of jellyfish."
"Richard E. Grant is the endlessly suave Dennis Bagley, a high-strung advertising executive whose shoulder sprouts an evil, talking boil. The boil speaks only to Bagley, is silent to the rest of the world, and seems to be growing. This caustic satire reunites the talented team behind the cult classic WITHNAIL AND I to create a tour de force of verbal jousting and physical comedy."
"As a brave couple demonstrates, the narrator uses quotes, examples, and advice to help us all reach the highest heights in the art of kissing."
An animated look at the eleven essential steps needed to make the pilgrim’s progress from finding a woman to making love to her.
"Directed by Wong Kar-wai • 2000 • Hong Kong

"Louis Malle presents his meditative investigation of the inner workings of a French automotive plant. This, Vive le Tour, and Place de la publique, Malle's three French-set documentaries, reveal, in an eclectic array of ways, the director's eternal fascination with, and respect for, the everyday lives of everyday people."
"Masaki Kobayashi’s mammoth humanist drama is one of the most staggering achievements of Japanese cinema. Originally filmed and released in three parts, the nine-and-a-half-hour THE HUMAN CONDITION (NINGEN NO JOKEN), adapted from Junpei Gomikawa’s six-volume novel, tells of the journey of the well-intentioned yet naive Kaji (handsome Japanese superstar Tatsuya Nakadai) from labor camp supervisor to Imperial Army soldier to Soviet POW. Constantly trying to rise above a corrupt system, Kaji time and again finds his morals an impediment rather than an advantage. A raw indictment of its nation’s wartime mentality as well as a personal existential tragedy, Kobayashi’s riveting, gorgeously filmed epic is novelistic cinema at its best."

"The transcendent second feature by Bruno Dumont probes the wonder and horror of the human condition through the story of a profoundly alienated police detective (the indelibly sad-eyed Emmanuel Schotté, winner of an upset best actor prize at Cannes for his first film performance) who, while investigating the murder of a young girl, experiences jolting, epiphanous moments of emotional and physical connection. Demonstrating Dumont’s deftness with nonactors and relentlessly frank depiction of bodies and sexuality, L’HUMANITÉ is at once an idiosyncratic police procedural and a provocative exploration of the tension between humankind’s capacity for compassion and our base, sometimes barbarous animal instincts."
"A poor, masterless Samurai who depends on the paper balloons his wife makes to feed his family becomes tempted by a criminal opportunity."
"This short film from 2014 stars Sophia Loren and was inspired by Jean Cocteau's 1930 play La voix humaine. It was directed by Edoardo Ponti, the son of Loren and producer Carlo Ponti."
"In this animated short, director Peter Foldes depicts one man’s descent into greed and gluttony. Rapidly dissolving and ever-evolving images create a contrast between abundance and want. One of the first films to use computer animation, this satire serves as a cautionary tale against self-indulgence in a world still plagued by hunger and poverty."
"With HUNGER, British filmmaker and artist Steve McQueen has turned one of history’s most controversial acts of political defiance into a jarring, unforgettable cinematic experience. In Northern Ireland’s Maze prison in 1981, twenty-seven-year-old Irish Republican Army member Bobby Sands went on a hunger strike to protest the British government’s refusal to recognize him and his fellow IRA inmates as political prisoners. McQueen dramatizes prison existence and Sands’s final days in a way that is purely experiential, even abstract, a succession of images full of both beauty and horror. Featuring an intense performance by Michael Fassbender, HUNGER is an unflinching, transcendent depiction of what a human being is willing to endure to be heard."
"In Hideo Gosha's film, loyalty and ambition lead to tragic consequences for a yakuza boss (Tatsuya Nakadai) and his bodyguard."
An informative and visually stunning study of two small species of crustaceans set to music.
"Mr Cooke dies, leaving his three spoiled children with an enormous inheritance. But there is one catch: in order to get their money, they are forced to live together forever. The three siblings detest one another violently and do nothing but bicker and try to torture one another all day. The oldest sibling, Charles, hires Dr. Schadenfreude to help him get rid of his siblings. Schadenfreude, however, has his own plans, and proceeds to use hypnotism, seduction, and criminality to turn the situation to his own ends. With exciting color, an outstanding cast, and original costumes and sets designed by director Anna Biller, the film is a stylish and witty tribute to old Hollywood Technicolor films."
"Bette Gordon and James Benning use optical printing effects to create, in their words, “intercourse between two people who never appear on the screen at the same time.”"
"A parallel film to Vilgot Sjöman's controversial I AM CURIOUS, YELLOW, I AM CURIOUS, BLUE also follows young Lena on her journey of self-discovery. In BLUE, Lena confronts issues of religion, sexuality, and the prison system, while at the same time exploring her own personal relationships. Like YELLOW, BLUE freely traverses the lines between fact and fiction, employing a mix of dramatic and documentary techniques."
"Seized by customs upon entry to the United States, subject of a heated court battle, and banned in numerous cities, Vilgot Sjöman's I Am Curious-Yellow is one of the most controversial films of all time. This landmark document of Swedish society during the sexual revolution has been declared both obscene and revolutionary. It tells the story of Lena (Lena Nyman), a searching and rebellious young woman, and her personal quest to understand the social and political conditions in 1960s Sweden, as well as her bold exploration of her own sexual identity. I Am Curious-Yellow is a subversive mix of dramatic and documentary techniques, attacking capitalist injustices and frankly addressing the politics of sexuality."
"The acclaimed debut feature from Rungano Nyoni is a daring, sharply satiric feminist fairy tale set in present-day Zambia. When nine-year-old orphan Shula (Margaret Mulubwa) is accused of witchcraft, she is exiled to a witch camp run by a corrupt and inept government official. Tied to the ground and told that she will turn into a goat if she tries to escape, Shula becomes a star tourist attraction exploited by those around her for financial gain. Soon she is forced to make a difficult decision: resign herself to life at the camp, or risk everything for freedom. Winner of a BAFTA award for outstanding debut, I AM NOT A WITCH is a visually imaginative, socially incisive commentary on the clash between tradition and modernity from one of contemporary cinema’s most exciting new voices."
"In Koreyoshi Kurahara's directorial debut, rebel matinee idol Yujiro Ishihara (fresh off the sensational Crazed Fruit) stars as a restaurant manager and former boxer who saves a beautiful, suicidal club hostess (Mie Kitahara) trying to escape the clutches of her gangster employer. Featuring expressionist lighting and bold camera work, this was one of Nikkatsu's early successes."
"In Alexander Korda's film of the Oscar Wilde play, a politician intending to expose a case of fraud must tread with care when a young woman threatens to blackmail him and tarnish his wife's view of him as 'an ideal husband.'"
"Michelangelo Antonioni’s IDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN is a body- and soul-baring voyage into one man’s artistic and erotic consciousness. After his wife leaves him, a film director finds himself drawn into affairs with two enigmatic women: at the same time, he searches for the right subject and actress for his next film. This spellbinding antiromance was a late-career coup for the legendary Italian filmmaker, and is renowned for its sexual explicitness and an extended scene on a fog-enshrouded highway that stands with the director’s greatest set pieces."
"In post-World War II Japan, childlike veteran Kinji suffers from post-traumatic stress-induced seizures, and, after treatment at a mental health institution in Okinawa, he returns to his hometown. There he meets and becomes romantically caught up with two women -- Taeko and Ayako. Another man, Denkichi, is passionately in love with Taeko, too. So when Kinji begins favoring Taeko, a violent conflict erupts between the two men."
"An embittered misanthrope is transformed into a reluctant do-gooder when a pair of angelic wings with a mind of their own sprouts from his back in this riotously surreal tale of unwanted redemption from animation visionary Bill Plympton. Told entirely without dialogue through a free-flowing rush of noir-tinged imagery and set to a soundtrack that includes Tom Waits and Pink Martini, IDIOTS AND ANGELS finds Plympton applying his characteristic dark humor to an outlandish exploration of the tension between good and evil."
"Idle hands are the devil's workshop; unemployed hands lead to pure mischief. Charlie Chaplin's iconic Tramp takes a ""vacation"" at a golf resort where he is mistaken for one of the members. The Tramp hopes to merely play through, but landing in this bunker has resulted in a severe penalty. After ""speaking"" with the officials all is resolved and the Tramp can continue his game."
"Ermanno Olmi’s masterful feature is the tender story of two Milanese fiancés whose strained relationship is tested when the man accepts a new job in Sicily. With the separation come loneliness, nostalgia, and, perhaps, some new perspectives that might rejuvenate their love. Olmi’s deep humanism charges this moving depiction of ordinary men and women, and the pitfalls of the human heart."

"In the high-octane, unorthodox romance I Hate But Love (Nikui Anchikusho), a celebrity (played by megastar Yujiro Ishihara), dissatisfied with his personal and professional lives, impulsively leaves fast-paced Tokyo to deliver a much-needed jeep to a remote village. When his controlling manager, the woman he loves (Ruriko Asaoka), follows, the two must reconcile while dodging reporters."
"One of the greatest achievements by Akira Kurosawa, IKIRU shows the director at his most compassionate—affirming life through an exploration of death. Takashi Shimura beautifully portrays Kanji Watanabe, an aging bureaucrat with stomach cancer who is impelled to find meaning in his final days. Presented in a radically conceived two­part structure and shot with a perceptive, humanistic clarity of vision, IKIRU is a multifaceted look at what it means to be alive."
"Following the gorgeous, seemingly liberated Adriana (DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE’s Stefania Sandrelli) as she chases her dreams in the Rome of LA DOLCE VITA, I KNEW HER WELL is at once a delightful immersion in the popular music and style of Italy in the sixties and a biting critique of its sexual politics and the culture of celebrity. Over a series of intimate episodes, just about every one featuring a different man, a new hairstyle, and an outfit to match, the unsung Italian master Antonio Pietrangeli, working from a script he cowrote with Ettore Scola, composes a deft, seriocomic character study that never strays from its complicated central figure. I KNEW HER WELL is a thrilling rediscovery, by turns funny, tragic, and altogether jaw-dropping."
"In Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s stunningly photographed comedy, romance flourishes in an unlikely place—the bleak and moody Scottish Hebrides. Wendy Hiller stars as a headstrong young woman who travels to these remote isles to marry a rich lord. Stranded by stormy weather, she meets a handsome naval officer (Roger Livesey) who threatens to thwart her carefully laid-out life plans."
"Both the final film of this period in which Akira Kurosawa would directly wrestle with the demons of the Second World War and his most literal representation of living in an atomic age, the galvanizing I LIVE IN FEAR presents Toshiro Mifune as an elderly, stubborn businessman so fearful of a nuclear attack that he resolves to move his reluctant family to South America. With this mournful film, the director depicts a society emerging from the shadows but still terrorized by memories of the past and anxieties for the future."
"The first feature documentary by counterculture chronicler Ron Mann is an eloquent tribute to a group of highly celebrated artists who helped forge the once-controversial free jazz movement of the 1960s. Bringing together interviews with and performances by legendary musicians like pianists Cecil Taylor and Paul Bley, tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp, and trumpet player Bill Dixon, this vital record of jazz history pays tribute to the innovators whose fearless artistic vision brought forth a revolution in sound."
"Cult animation surrealist Bill Plympton lets his subversive worldview and flair for grotesque absurdity run riot in this deliriously deranged dark comedy. A newlywed woman gets an unsettling surprise when she discovers that her husband has a strange lump on his neck that gives him the ability to transform people or objects at will—a superpower that proves especially useful during sex. When the sinister CEO of Smilecorp learns of the man’s unique abilities, he sees a way to achieve world domination—if only the man can be taken alive."
"Veronica Lake casts a seductive spell as a charmingly vengeful sorceress in this supernatural screwball classic. Many centuries after cursing the male descendants of the Salem puritan who sent her to the stake, this blonde bombshell with a broomstick finds herself drawn to one of them—a prospective governor (Fredric March) about to marry a spoiled socialite (Susan Hayward). The most delightful of the films the innovative French director René Clair made in Hollywood, I MARRIED A WITCH is a comic confection bursting with playful special effects and sparkling witticisms."
"AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS features a screening of Charlie Chaplin’s 1917 film THE IMMIGRANT, which features Chaplin’s Little Tramp as an immigrant sailing for the United States. Director Louis Malle chose this film because “it was an evocation of freedom for those Jewish children when they see the Statue of Liberty, America being the promised land.”"
"A woman is pushed to marry a rich but impaired man against her will, but soon her estranged lover reappears... Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
"Orson Welles' first color film and final completed fictional feature, THE IMMORTAL STORY is a moving and wistful adaptation of a tale by Isak Dinesen. Welles stars as a wealthy merchant in nineteenth-century Macao, who becomes obsessed with bringing to life an oft-related anecdote about a rich man who gives a poor sailor a small sum of money to impregnate his wife. Also starring an ethereal Jeanne Moreau, this jewel-like film, dreamily shot by Willy Kurant and suffused with the music of Erik Satie, is a brooding, evocative distillation of Welles' artistic interests, a story about the nature of storytelling and the fine line between illusion and reality."
"Oscar Wilde’s comic jewel sparkles in Anthony Asquith’s film adaptation of THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST. Featuring brilliantly polished performances by Michael Redgrave, Joan Greenwood, and Dame Edith Evans, the enduringly hilarious story of two young women who think themselves engaged to the same nonexistent man is given the grand Technicolor treatment. Seldom has a classic stage comedy been so engagingly transferred to the screen."
"Made in collaboration with the celebrated avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, IN ABSENTIA combines live action and animation with dazzling use of light to convey the mindscape of a woman alone in a room repeatedly writing a letter with broken off-pieces of pencil lead, while outside her window vistas of ever changing light register her every emotion."
"This heartrendingly compassionate tragedy from Rainer Werner Fassbinder traces the final days in the life of Elvira (Volker Spengler), a transgender woman spurned by her former lover, as she reaches out desperately for understanding. With infinite empathy for the plight of the dispossessed, Fassbinder crafts a searing statement on both the universal need for love and the human capacity for cruelty."
INCIDENT BY A BANK is a detailed and humorous account of a failed bank robbery: A single take where over 96 people perform a meticulous choreography for the camera. This short film recreates an actual event that took place in Stockholm back in June 2006; it's an observation in real-time and a study of how people act and react to the unexpected.
Roberto Rossellini blends documentary and fiction in his unique portrait of India.
"Romanian New Wave leader Corneliu Porumboiu (12:08 EAST OF BUCHAREST) directs this at once hilarious and poignant look at an ordinary man’s extraordinary ambitions. Ever since a leg fracture ended his aspirations of becoming a soccer player, Laurentiu Ginghina, now a bureaucrat working in a drab government office, has devoted himself, with single-minded zeal, to reinventing the game, proposing it be radically altered (starting with reimagining the shape of the field as an octagon) in order to reduce player injuries. With both humor and humanity, Porumboiu’s marvelously offbeat, continually surprising documentary introduces us to an unforgettable individual, a self-proclaimed superman whose quixotic quest mirrors the hopes and dreams of his own country."
"The sixty-seven minute VERNAL EQUINOX was a work originally intended to represent spring in Hollis Frampton’s seasonal film cycle SOLARIUMAGEANI (1974). He later repurposed the film, calling it INGENIVM NOBIS IPSA PVELLA FECIT and dividing it into thirteen sections to be shown during the phase Straits of Magellan; the opening part is presented here. According to avant-garde film historian P. Adams Sitney, the new title can be translated as ‘The Girl Herself Gave Us the Idea’ or ‘The Girl Herself Did the Trick for Us.’"
"The year is 1961 and Ingmar Bergman is making a movie. While planted on the scene as apprentice to Bergman, Vilgot Sjöman (director, I AM CURIOUS–YELLOW, 1967), and a crew from Swedish Television begin to capture what would become a comprehensive five-part documentary on the making of WINTER LIGHT."
"Whether headlining films in Sweden, Italy, or Hollywood, Ingrid Bergman always pierced the screen with a singular soulfulness. With this new documentary, made on the occasion of the one hundredth anniversary of Bergman's birth, director Stig Björkman allows us unprecedented access to her world, culling from the most personal of archival materials, letters, diary entries, photographs, and 8 mm and 16 mm footage Bergman herself shot, and following her from youth to tumultuous married life and motherhood. Intimate and artful, this lovingly assembled portrait, narrated by actor Alicia Vikander, provides luminous insight into the life and career of an undiminished legend."
"The life, culture and food of the polka culture in America today."
"On his deathbed, a wealthy businessman announces that his fortune is to be split equally among his three illegitimate children, whose whereabouts are unknown. A bevy of lawyers and associates begin machinations to procure the money for themselves, resorting to the use of impostors and blackmail. Yet all are outwitted by the cunning of the man's secretary (Keiko Kishi), in this entertaining condemnation of unchecked greed."
"In 1971, author and film scholar Donald Richie published a poetic travelogue about his explorations of the islands of Japan’s Inland Sea, recording his search for traces of a traditional way of life as well as his own journey of self-discovery. Twenty years later, filmmaker Lucille Carra undertook a parallel trip inspired by Richie’s by-then-classic book, capturing images of hushed beauty and meeting people who still carried on the fading customs that Richie had observed. Interspersed with surprising detours—a visit to a Frank Sinatra–loving monk, a leper colony, an ersatz temple of plywood and plaster—and woven together by Richie’s narration as well as a score by celebrated composer Toru Takemitsu, THE INLAND SEA is an eye-opening voyage and a profound meditation on what it means to be a foreigner."
"Unemployed Kihachi and his two sons struggle to make ends meet, but that doesn't keep Kihachi from wooing single mother Otaka."
"This utterly unclassifiable film is one of Makavejev's most freewheeling farces, assembled from the ""lost"" footage of the first Serbian talkie, a silly melodrama titled Innocence Unprotected, made during the Nazi occupation; contemporary interviews with the megaman who made it and other crew members; and images of the World War II destruction, and subsequent rebuilding, of Belgrade. And at its center is a (real-life) character you won't soon forget: Dragoljub Aleksic, an acrobat, locksmith, and Houdini-style escape artist whom Makavejev uses as the absurd and wondrous basis for a look back at his country's tumultuous recent history."
"Heinosuke Gosho's darkest and most acclaimed film of the '60s, AN INNOCENT WITCH recounts the life of a young woman who is sold by her family into a brothel in a rural fishing village."
"Born in a rural farming village in 1918, Tomé survives decades of Japanese social upheaval, as well as abuse and servitude at the hands of various men. Yet Shohei Imamura, ever the cinematic “entomologist,” refuses to make a victim of her, instead observing Tomé (played by the extraordinary Sachiko Hidari) as a fascinating, pragmatic creature of twentieth-century Japan. A portrait of opportunism and resilience in three generations of women, THE INSECT WOMAN is Imamura’s most expansive film, and Tomé his ultimate heroine."
"Jealousy and violence take center stage in this claustrophobic melodrama, a tautly constructed character study set in the slums of Manila. Lino Brocka crafts an eviscerating portrait of an innocent daughter and her bitter mother as women scorned. Insiang leads a quiet life dominated by household duties, but after she is raped by her mother’s lover and abandoned by the young man who claims to care for her, she exacts vicious revenge. A savage commentary on the degradations of urban poverty, especially for women, INSIANG was the first Philippine film ever to play at Cannes."
"Christine Choy and Cynthia Maurizio offer a rare look at the degradation faced by women in prison, interviewing women who suffer daily within a system that disregards their humanity and neglects their basic needs."
"Four unnamed people who look and sound a lot like Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and Joseph McCarthy converge in one New York City hotel room in this compelling, visually inventive adaptation of Terry Johnson’s play, from director Nicolas Roeg. With a combination of whimsy and dread, Roeg creates a fun-house-mirror image of fifties America in order to reflect on the nature of celebrity and lingering cold-war nuclear nightmares. INSIGNIFICANCE is a delirious, intelligent drama, featuring magnetic performances by Michael Emil as the Professor, Theresa Russell as the Actress, Gary Busey as the Ballplayer, and Tony Curtis as the Senator."
"In this elegantly unsettling murder mystery, Stellan Skarsgård plays an enigmatic Swedish detective with a checkered past who arrives in a small town in northern Norway to investigate the death of a teenage girl. As he digs deeper into the facts surrounding the heinous killing, his own demons and the tyrannical midnight sun begin to take a toll. The success of Erik Skjoldbjærg’s chilling procedural anticipated the international hunger for Scandinavian noirs and serial-killer fictions, and the film features one of Skarsgård’s greatest performances."
"Sadako (Masumi Harukawa), cursed by generations before her and neglected by her common-law husband, falls prey to a brutal home intruder. But rather than become a victim, she forges a path to her own awakening. This disturbing and pitiless evocation of domestic drudgery and sexual violence is also a fascinating, unsentimental account of one woman’s determination. Filled with director Shohei Imamura’s characteristic flashbacks and dream sequences, INTENTIONS OF MURDER is a gripping, audacious portrait of a woman coming into her own in a man’s world."
"In 1965, director Jan Troell took part in the film 4 X 4, which comprises four shorts, each from a different Nordic country. Troell’s Swedish entry, INTERLUDE IN THE MARSHLAND, starring Max von Sydow and produced and cowritten by Bengt Forslund, is based on a story by Eyvind Johnson, author of the novels that form the basis for HERE IS YOUR LIFE."
"On a visit home, the famous concert violinist Holger Brandt sweeps Anita Hoffman off her feet. She is a promising young pianist and gives lessons to Brandt's daughter Marie. He convinces her that he loves her when he leaves his wife and family and asks Anita to travel with him as his accompanist. She accepts. They tour all the major cities of Europe together. It is all very romantic and when the tour is over they go to Austria for a vacation. Anita learns that she has won a grant to continue her studies and Holger begins to miss his family, so when his impressario Charles advises Anita to leave Holger, for her own good as well as his, she does so. Holger then returns to Stockholm. On his arrival his daughter is hit by a car. She survives and Holger realizes that his wife and home and family are more than important to him than anything else."
Roberto Rossellini interviews Chilean politician Salvador Allende.
"Hong Kong, 1962: Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) move into neighboring apartments on the same day. Their encounters are formal and polite—until a discovery about their spouses creates an intimate bond between them. At once delicately mannered and visually extravagant, Wong Kar-wai’s IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE is a masterful evocation of romantic longing and fleeting moments. With its aching musical soundtrack and exquisitely abstract cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Mark Lee Ping-bin, this film has been a major stylistic influence on the past decade of cinema, and is a milestone in Wong’s redoubtable career."
"IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES (AI NO CORRIDA), by the always provocative Japanese director Nagisa Oshima, remains one of the most controversial films of all time. Based on a true incident, it graphically depicts the all-consuming, transcendent—but ultimately destructive—love of a man and a woman (Tatsuya Fuji and Eiko Matsuda) living in an era of ever escalating imperialism and governmental control. Less a work of pornography than of politics, IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES is a brave, taboo-breaking milestone, still censored in its own country. WARNING: THIS FILM IS SEXUALLY EXPLICIT"
"One of the most beloved films of the Czechoslovak New Wave, this digressive, easygoing slice of life takes place over the course of a weekend in a provincial town where a musician returns, along with his glamorous lover, to visit an old friend. Meandering and consistently surprising, INTIMATE LIGHTING skirts the demands of plot in favor of subtler shades of mood. The only feature that Ivan Passer (CUTTER’S WAY) directed before decamping to Hollywood along with his friend and collaborator Miloš Forman, it was banned for two decades by state censorship."
A lodger staying with a middle aged woman and her teenage daughter finds himself in the middle of a precarious love triangle.
"Koreyoshi Kurahara's ingeniously plotted, pocket-size noir concerns the intertwined fates of a desperate bank manager, blackmailed for book-cooking, and his resentful but timid underling, passed over for a promotion. The marvelously moody Intimidation (Aru kyouhaku) is an elegantly stripped-down and carefully paced crime drama."
"For the extraordinarily beautiful second film in his Fontainhas trilogy, Pedro Costa jettisoned his earlier films' larger crews to burrow even deeper into the Lisbon ghetto and the lives of its desperate inhabitants. With the intimate feel of a documentary and the texture of a Vermeer painting, IN VANDA'S ROOM takes an unflinching, fragmentary look at a handful of self-destructive, marginalized people, but is centered around the heroin-addicted Vanda Duarte. Costa presents the daily routines of Vanda and her neighbors with disarming matter-of-factness, and through his camera, individuals whom many would deem disposable become vivid and vital. This was Costa's first use of digital video, and the evocative images he created remain some of the medium's most astonishing."
"Aliens from Planet X make an irresistible offer to the people of Earth: let them borrow Godzilla and Rodan to help defeat King Ghidorah, and in return they will provide a cure for all known human disease. But the aliens’ duplicity is soon revealed, as they deploy all three monsters in their quest to conquer Earth. This retro romp, featuring American star Nick Adams, stands as a high point in the Showa Godzilla series."
"This eye-popping escapade revolves around a scientist and his doomsday machine—and the pirates who will stop at nothing to gain possession of it. Freely adapting the fiction of Jules Verne, and inspired by Victorian line engravings, Karel Zeman surrounds his actors with animated scenery of breathtaking intricacy and complexity, constructing an impossibly vivid proto-steampunk world. Released abroad at the turn of the 1960s, INVENTION FOR DESTRUCTION went on to become one of the most internationally successful Czechoslovak films of all time."
"In the midst of World War II, the renowned playwright Noël Coward engaged a young film editor named David Lean to help him realize his vision for an action drama about a group of Royal Navy sailors (roles that would be filled by Coward himself, Bernard Miles, and John Mills, among others) fighting the Germans in the Mediterranean. Coward and Lean ended up codirecting the large-scale project—an impressive undertaking, especially considering that neither of them had directed for the big screen before (this would be Coward’s only such credit). Cutting between a major naval battle and flashbacks to the men’s lives before they left home, IN WHICH WE SERVE (an Oscar nominee for best picture) was a major breakthrough for both filmmakers and a sensitive and stirring piece of propaganda."
"Olivier Assayas’s live-wire international breakthrough stars a magnetic Maggie Cheung as a version of herself: a Hong Kong action movie star who arrives in Paris to play the latex-clad lead in a remake of Louis Feuillade’s classic 1915 crime serial LES VAMPIRES. What she finds is a behind-the-scenes tangle of barely controlled chaos as egos clash, romantic attractions simmer, and an obsessive director (a cannily cast Jean-Pierre Léaud) drives himself to the brink to realize his vision. Blending blasts of silent cinema, martial arts flicks, and the music of Sonic Youth and Ali Farka Touré into a hallucinatory swirl of postmodern cool, Assayas composes a witty reflection on the nineties French film industry and the eternal tension between art and commercial entertainment."
"After being mistaken for an Interpol agent, a man who was just supposed to go on vacation gets mixed up in a war between two gangs intent on winning the favor of a notorious arms dealer."
"A young Irish woman, who loathes the British, becomes entangled in a plot to break a Nazi spy out of prison."
"After years of crime reporting, screenwriting, and authoring pulp novels, Samuel Fuller made his directorial debut with the lonesome ballad of Robert Ford (played by Red River's John Ireland), who fatally betrayed his friend, the notorious Jesse James. At once modest and intense, I Shot Jesse James is an engrossing pocket portrait of guilt and psychological torment, and an auspicious beginning for the maverick filmmaker."
"For two brief weeks in May of 1983, Christo and Jeanne-Claude's piece entitled Surrounded Islands blossomed on the waters of Biscayne Bay, Florida. Eleven scrub-pine islands were surrounded by 6.5 million square feet of bright pink fabric. A three-year struggle, a work of art; a political drama interwoven with two other projects-in-progress; the wrapping of the Pont Neuf in Paris and the Reichstag in Berlin."
"A young Bing Crosby croons “I Surrender Dear,” “Out of Nowhere,” and “At Your Command” in this light romantic farce directed by screen-comedy legend Mack Sennett."
"In one of his most personal works, Martin Scorsese sits down with his parents, Catherine and Charles, in their New York apartment for a free-flowing discussion that touches on family history, the immigrant experience, and the meaning of Italian American identity."
"As her latest film, the 2020 Sundance and Berlin award winner NEVER RARELY SOMETIMES ALWAYS, garners critical acclaim, the Criterion Channel revisits the revelatory debut feature from director Eliza Hittman. Set over the course of a languid South Brooklyn summer, this unflinchingly honest, refreshingly unsentimental tale of sexual exploration and awakening centers on Lila (Gina Piersanti, in a remarkable debut), a lonely fourteen-year-old girl who pushes herself into frightening and dangerous new territory in a quest to experience love. With an eye for evocative, richly sensorial images, Hittman offers a bracing, startlingly intimate new take on the coming-of-age drama."
"Released a year before Roe v. Wade, this short film by Amalie Rothschild lays out the dire realities of illegal abortion, interviewing women from a variety of backgrounds who made the choice to terminate a pregnancy."
"Made while Martin Scorsese was studying at NYU, this inventive, award-winning student film pays tongue-in-cheek homage to the classic gangster movie via a portrait of a high-rolling mobster looking back on his life."
"The debut feature by the great Andrei Tarkovsky, IVAN’S CHILDHOOD is a poetic journey through the shards and shadows of one boy’s war-ravaged youth. Moving back and forth between the traumatic realities of World War II and serene moments of family life before the conflict began, Tarkovsky’s film remains one of the most jarring and unforgettable depictions of the impact of war on children."
"Navigating the deadly waters of Stalinist politics, Eisenstein was able to film two parts of his planned trilogy about the troubled sixteenth-century tsar who united Russia. Visually stunning and powerfully acted, IVAN THE TERRIBLE charts the rise to power and descent into terror of this veritable dictator. Though pleased with the first installment, Stalin detected the portrait in the second film, with its summary executions and secret police, and promptly banned it."

"Five young men linger in a postadolescent limbo, dreaming of adventure and escape from their small seacoast town. They while away their time spending the lira doled out by their indulgent families on drink, women, and nights at the local pool hall. Federico Fellini’s second solo directorial effort (originally released in the U.S. as THE YOUNG AND THE PASSIONATE) is a semiautobiographical masterpiece of sharply drawn character sketches: skirt chaser Fausto, forced to marry a girl he has impregnated; Alberto, the perpetual child; Leopoldo, a writer thirsting for fame; and Moraldo, the only member of the group troubled by a moral conscience. An international success and recipient of an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay, I VITELLONI compassionately details a year in the life of a group of small-town layabouts struggling to find meaning in their lives."
"A group of teens looking to score some weed unwittingly turn their drug dealer into a rampaging zombie. The film features music by the Fleshtones, the Violent Femmes, Los Lobos, and others."
"One of Ozu's most popular films, I Was Born, But . . . is a blithe portrait of the financial and psychological toils of one family, as told from the rascally point of view of a couple of stubborn little boys. For two brothers, the daily struggles of bullies and mean teachers is nothing next to the mortification they feel when they realize their good-natured father's low-rung social status. Reworked decades later as Ozu's Technicolor comedy Good Morning, it's a poignant evocation of the tumult of childhood, as well as a showcase for Ozu's expertly timed comedy editing."
"Masaki Kobayashi's pitiless take on Japan's professional baseball industry is unlike any other sports film ever made. A condemnation of the inhumanity bred by a mercenary, bribery-fueled business, it follows the sharklike maneuvers of a scout dead set on signing a promising player to the team the Toyo Flowers."
"Agnès Varda’s tender evocation of the childhood of her husband, Jacques Demy—a dream project that she realized for him when he became too ill to direct it himself—is a wonder-filled portrait of the artist as a young man and an enchanting ode to the magic of cinema. Shot in Demy’s hometown of Nantes (including the house he grew up in), this imaginative blend of narrative and documentary traces his coming of age as he finds escape from the tumult of World War II in puppet shows, fairy tales, opera, and, above all, movies—the formative aesthetic experiences that would fuel his vivid Technicolor imagination and find unforgettable expression in his exuberant New Wave masterworks. Interspersing intimate footage of the older Demy reflecting on his life’s journey, JACQUOT DE NANTES is a poignant love letter from one visionary artist to another."
"The interests, obsessions, and fantasies of two singular artists converge in this inspired collaboration between Agnès Varda and her longtime friend the actor Jane Birkin. Made over the course of a year and motivated by Birkin’s fortieth birthday—a milestone she admits to some anxiety over—JANE B. PAR AGNÈS V. contrasts the private, reflective Birkin with Birkin the icon, as Varda casts her variously as a classical muse, a femme fatale, a Spanish dancer, Joan of Arc, and even a deadpan Laurel opposite a clownish Hardy in a fanciful slapstick spoof. Made in the spirit of pure, uninhibited play, this free-flowing dual portrait unfolds as a shared reverie between two women as they collapse the boundaries between artist and subject."
"The Newsreel collective’s JANIE’S JANIE breaks with the group’s usual format for a more personal approach, following a woman’s journey to self-determination; or, as Janie says, “First I was my father’s Janie, then I was my Charlie’s Janie, now I’m Janie’s Janie."""
"Cheryl Dunye recounts the story of a black lesbian’s relationship with a white, upper-middle-class high school girl."
"Hiroshi Shimizu's exquisite silent drama, set in the modernizing port town of Yokohama, tells of the humiliating downfall experienced by Sunako (Michiko Oikawa) after jealousy drives her to commit a terrible crime. With its lushly photographed landscapes and innovative visual storytelling, JAPANESE GIRLS AT THE HARBOR shows a director at the peak of his powers and experimentation. The film is presented with a new score written and performed by noted silent-film composer Donald Sosin."
"A sex-obsessed young woman, a suicidal man she meets on the street, a gun-crazy wannabe gangster, these are just three of the irrational, oddball anarchists trapped in an underground hideaway in Oshima's devilish, absurdist portrait of what he deemed the death drive in Japanese youth culture."
"Having lost her husband in World War II, a woman struggles to raise her children in postwar Japan."
"In this preternaturally assured feature debut by Carlos Reygadas, a man (Alejandro Ferretis) travels from Mexico City to an isolated village to commit suicide; once there, however, he meets a pious elderly woman (Magdalena Flores) whose quiet humanity incites a reawakening of his desires. Recruiting a cast of nonactors and filming in sublime 16 mm CinemaScope, Reygadas explores the harsh beauty of the Mexican country­side with earthy tactility, conjuring a psychic landscape where religion mingles with sex, life coexists with death, and the animal and spiritual sides of human experience become indistinguishable. A work of soaring ambition and startling visual poetry, JAPÓN is an existential journey through uncharted cinematic territory that established the singular voice of its director."
"A singular work in film history, Chantal Akerman’s JEANNE DIELMAN, 23, QUAI DU COMMERCE, 1080 BRUXELLES meticulously details, with a sense of impending doom, the daily routine of a middle-aged widow, whose chores include making the beds, cooking dinner for her son, and turning the occasional trick. In its enormous spareness, Akerman’s film seems simple, but it encompasses an entire world. Whether seen as an exacting character study or as one of cinema’s most hypnotic and complete depictions of space and time, JEANNE DIELMAN is an astonishing, compelling movie experiment, one that has been analyzed and argued over for decades."
This carnivalesque fairy tale of whimsical costumes and kaleidoscopic colors blends live action and stop-motion animation into an enchanting flight of imagination that plays like an antique children’s music box come to life.
"The world-famous artist Takashi Murakami made his directorial debut with JELLYFISH EYES, taking his boundless imagination to the screen in a tale of friendship and loyalty that also addresses humanity’s propensity for destruction. After moving to a country town with his mother following his father’s death, a young boy befriends a charming, flying, jellyfish-like sprite—only to discover that his schoolmates have similar friends, and that neither they nor the town itself are what they seem to be. Pointedly set in a post-Fukushima world, Murakami’s modest-budgeted special effects extravaganza boasts unforgettable creature designs and carries a message of cooperation and hope for all ages."
"Chris Marker, filmmaker, poet, novelist, photographer, editor, and now videographer and digital multimedia artist, has been challenging moviegoers, philosophers, and himself for years with his complex queries about time, memory, and the rapid advancement of life on this planet. Marker’s LA JETÉE is one of the most influential, radical science-fiction films ever made, a tale of time travel told in still images."
"In her provocative first feature, Chantal Akerman stars as an aimless young woman who leaves self-imposed isolation to embark on a road trip that leads to lonely love affairs with a male truck driver and a former girlfriend. With its famous real-time carnal encounter and its daring minimalism, Je tu il elle is Akerman's most sexually audacious film."
"Shocking, outrageous, and poetic, JIGOKU (HELL, a.k.a. THE SINNERS OF HELL) is the most innovative creation from Nobuo Nakagawa, the father of the Japanese horror film. After a young theology student flees a hit-and-run accident, he is plagued by both his own guilt-ridden conscience and a mysterious, diabolical doppelgänger. But all possible escape routes lead straight to hell, literally. In the gloriously gory final third of the film, Nakagawa offers up his vision of the underworld in a tour de force of torture and degradation. A striking departure from traditional Japanese ghost stories, JIGOKU, with its truly eye-popping (and -gouging) imagery, created aftershocks that are still reverberating in contemporary world horror cinema."
"Jimi Hendrix arrived in California virtually unknown. Returning stateside from London, where he had moved to launch his musical career, Hendrix exploded at Monterey, flooring an unsuspecting audience with his maniacal six-string pyrotechnics. JIMI PLAYS MONTEREY features the entire set of this legendary musician, a performance that has entered rock-and-roll mythology."
"Unfolding in a series of hypnotically choreographed long takes, this enigmatic meditation on police violence and the nature of truth recounts a fatal encounter in a French housing project from the contrasting perspectives of multiple witnesses. "
"Made in 2008 by Shauna McGarry, this short documentary traces the origins of the “Joanie 4 Jackie” project."
"Narrated by Mathieu Amalric, this innovative documentary revisits a wealth of 16 mm footage of tennis superstar John McEnroe taken at the height of his career, when he competed to defend his status as the world’s top-ranked player at the 1984 French Open. Close-ups and slow-motion sequences of McEnroe playing, as well as flare-ups of his notorious on-court tantrums, reveal a “man who played on the edge of his senses.” Far from a traditional sports documentary, JOHN MCENROE: IN THE REALM OF PERFECTION expressively reshapes its material to explore both McEnroe’s game and the footage itself, creating a mesmerizing, immersive study of a driven athlete, the human body in motion, and cinema itself."
"JOHN'S GONE is a fever dream comedy. John sells things online, cheats off dollar stores, needs friends but settles for strangers, has roaches."
"For his directorial debut, comedy great Richard Pryor drew from one of the most painful incidents in his own life to tell the story of one man’s journey through triumph and tragedy. At the peak of his popularity, comedian Jo Jo Dancer (Pryor) seems to have it all: stardom, movie roles, record deals. But the price he pays for fame and fortune is too great. After buckling under the pressures of success and suffering a life-threatening accident, Jo Jo examines his life over the past four decades—from his upbringing in a brothel, to performances in seedy cellar nightclubs, to ultimate stardom as a rowdy, irreverent comic. Featuring music by Herbie Hancock and a score of classic R&B hits, JO JO DANCER, YOUR LIFE IS CALLING is a fearlessly personal statement from one of comedy’s most influential figures."
"Jaromil Jire≈°'s brilliant adaptation of Milan Kundera's novel tells the fragmentary tale of a man expelled from the Communist Party because of a political joke. After ""rehabilitation"" in the mines and a stint in prison, he hatches a revenge plot against the former friend who betrayed him. Made near the end of the Czech New Wave, The Joke is acknowledged as one of its greatest works."
Avant-garde titan Ken Jacobs captures a candid moment with Jonas Mekas “dawdling in the cosmos.”
"In his enchanting debut feature, Jacques Tati stars as a fussbudget of a postman who is thrown for a loop when a traveling fair comes to his village. Even in this early work, Tati was brilliantly toying with the devices (silent visual gags, minimal yet deftly deployed sound effects) and exploring the theme (the absurdity of our increasing reliance on technology) that would define his cinema."
"Among the most influential films of the postwar era, Roberto Rossellini’s JOURNEY TO ITALY (VIAGGIO IN ITALIA) charts the declining marriage of a couple from England (Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders) on a trip in the countryside near Naples. More than just the anatomy of a relationship, Rossellini’s masterpiece is a heartrending work of emotion and spirituality. Considered a predecessor to the existentialist works of Michelangelo Antonioni and hailed as a groundbreaking modernist work by the legendary film journal “Cahiers du cinéma,” JOURNEY TO ITALY is a breathtaking cinematic benchmark."
"In feminist filmmaker Joyce Chopra’s JOYCE AT 34 (codirected with Claudia Weill, who would later direct the great unsung GIRLFRIENDS), Chopra examines the demands of juggling a baby and a professional career."
"Entirely hand-painted, JOY STREET is the ambitious, astonishing story of a woman’s journey from suicidal despair to personal renewal with the help of an unlikely spirit guide. Using a Fulbright scholar award, Pitt traveled to remote rainforest regions of Mexico and Guatemala to create paintings of the nearly extinct patches of remaining virgin forest, which were later animated for the film. The music was composed by Roy Nathanson and the Jazz Passengers, with the title song recorded by Debbie Harry."
"As World War II escalates, the tight-knit inhabitants of a street in Tokyo must relocate from their homes so the government can use the space. Kinoshita's sensitive film, beautifully and resourcefully shot, traces the fears and desires of the evacuees."
"When Queen Elizabeth I asks her court alchemist to show her England in the future, she’s transported 400 years to a post-apocalyptic wasteland of roving girl gangs, an all-powerful media mogul, fascistic police, scattered filth, and twisted sex. With JUBILEE, legendary British filmmaker Derek Jarman channeled political dissent and artistic daring into a revolutionary blend of history and fantasy, musical and cinematic experimentation, satire and anger, fashion and philosophy. With its uninhibited punk petulance and sloganeering, JUBILEE brings together many cultural and musical icons of the time, including Jordan, Toyah Willcox, Little Nell, Wayne County, Adam Ant, and Brian Eno (with his first original film score), to create a genuinely unique, unforgettable vision. Ahead of its time and often frighteningly accurate in its predictions, it is a fascinating historical document and a gorgeous work of film art."
"This effortlessly cool crime caper, directed by Georges Franju, is a marvel of dexterous plotting and visual invention. Conceived as an homage to Louis Feuillade’s 1916 cult silent serial of the same name, JUDEX kicks off with the mysterious kidnapping of a corrupt banker by a shadowy crime fighter (American magician Channing Pollock) and spins out into a thrillingly complex web of deceptions. Combining stylish sixties modernism with silent-cinema touches and even a few unexpected sci-fi accents, JUDEX is a delightful bit of pulp fiction and a testament to the art of illusion."
"Hailed as one of the finest films ever made, JULES AND JIM charts, over twenty-five years, the relationship between two friends and the object of their mutual obsession. The legendary François Truffaut directs, and Jeanne Moreau stars as the alluring and willful Catherine, whose enigmatic smile and passionate nature lure Jules (Oskar Werner) and Jim (Henri Serre) into one of cinema’s most captivating romantic triangles. An exuberant and poignant meditation on freedom, loyalty, and the fortitude of love, JULES AND JIM was a worldwide smash in 1962 and remains every bit as audacious and entrancing today."
"Cinematographer Gianni di Venanzo’s masterful use of Technicolor transforms JULIET OF THE SPIRITS, Fellini’s first color feature, into a kaleidoscope of dreams, spirits, and memories. Giulietta Masina plays a betrayed wife whose inability to come to terms with reality leads her along a hallucinatory journey of self-discovery. "
A woman is haunted by the press after the disastrous and violent end of her most recent relationship.
"This Korda brothers film is the definitive version of Rudyard Kipling's classic collection of fables. Sabu stars as Mowgli, a boy raised by wolves, who can communicate with all the beasts of the jungle, friend or foe, and who gradually reacclimatizes to civilization with the help of his long lost mother and a beautiful village girl. Deftly integrating real animals into its fanciful narrative, Jungle Book is a shimmering Technicolor feast, and was nominated for four Oscars, including best cinematography, art direction, special effects, and music."
"The filming of the Vertigo sequences in Sans Soleil brought director Chris Marker to the Bay Area on a number of occasions in the early eighties. During those visits, Marker's friend Tom Luddy often drove him from Berkeley to Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope film offices in San Francisco. That journey passed by the Emeryville Mudflats, an ever-changing art gallery of driftwood sculptures and structures that intrigued Marker. Created by anonymous artists, the works would regularly wash away with the tides, only to be replaced by new ones. One day, with the help of some of the Zoetrope crew, Marker went out to immortalize the scene, which no longer exists."
"In his debut film, Juraj Herz adapts Bohumil Hrabal's story about a man who works in a junk shop."
"Suburban neighbors join together to build a garden shed, but end up demolishing their garden in this short silent comedy."
"A day in the life of a Husband and a Wife, living in a world of giant monsters."
"In this downbeat, comedic portrait of '80s corporate Japan, a section chief and family man (played, in an award-winning performance, by Hajime Hana) fights off the gloom of his impending retirement by rekindling his youthful love of jazz music."
"When a coal mine collapses on the frontier between Germany and France, trapping a team of French miners inside, workers on both sides of the border spring into action, putting aside national prejudices and wartime grudges to launch a dangerous rescue operation. Director G. W. Pabst brings a claustrophobic realism to this ticking-clock scenario, using realistic sets and sound design to create the maze of soot-choked shafts where the miners struggle for survival. A gripping disaster film and a stirring plea for international cooperation, KAMERADSCHAFT cemented Pabst's status as one of the most morally engaged and formally dexterous filmmakers of his time."
"“Watch them closely, for these are the last hours of their lives,” announces a narrator, foretelling the tragedy that unfolds as a war-ravaged company of Home Army resistance fighters tries to escape the Nazi onslaught through the sewers of Warsaw. Determined to survive, the men and women slog through the hellish labyrinth, piercing the darkness with the strength of their individual spirits. Based on true events, KANAL was the first film ever made about the Warsaw Uprising and brought director Andrzej Wajda to the attention of international audiences, earning the Special Jury Prize in Cannes in 1957."
"Before he left his mark on cinema forever with the revolutionary The Battle of Algiers, Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo directed this audacious World War II drama about a young Jewish woman (Susan Strasberg) in a Nazi concentration camp, who saves herself from death by assuming another's identity and becoming a ruthless warden. The Oscar-nominated Kapò was one of the first films to depict the horror of the Holocaust, and it does so with brutality and daring emotional complexity."
"This gripping nonfiction thriller follows actress Kate Lyn Sheil as she prepares for her next role: playing Christine Chubbuck, a Florida newscaster who committed a shocking act on live television in 1974. As Kate investigates Chubbuck’s story (long rumored to be the inspiration for the classic Hollywood film NETWORK), uncovering new clues and information, she becomes increasingly obsessed with her subject. Winner of a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival, KATE PLAYS CHRISTINE is a cinematic mystery that forces us to question everything we see and everything we’re led to believe."
The arrival of a Greek immigrant alters the lives of a group of friends in West Germany.
"Charlie Chaplin was already an international star when he decided to break out of the short-film format and make his first full-length feature. THE KID doesn't merely show Chaplin at a turning point, when he proved that he was a serious film director, it remains an expressive masterwork of silent cinema. In it, he stars as his lovable Tramp character, this time raising an orphan (a remarkable young Jackie Coogan) he has rescued from the streets. Chaplin and Coogan make a miraculous pair in this nimble marriage of sentiment and slapstick, a film that is, as its opening title card states, ""a picture with a smile, and perhaps, a tear"""
"Silent-comedy legend Harold Lloyd goes west in this irresistible blend of action, romance, and slapstick invention. The bespec­tacled everyman is at his inimitable best as Harold Hickory, the gentle son of a prominent lawman who lives in the shadow of his rough-and-tumble brothers. When a traveling medicine show rolls into town, it brings with it excitement, the possibility of love, and a chance for Harold to prove his mettle. Deftly balancing Lloyd’s brilliant sight gags and thrilling set pieces—including an epic, knock-down, drag-out fight aboard an abandoned ship—with one of the actor-filmmaker’s most fully realized, root-for-the-underdog narratives, THE KID BROTHER is a hilarious and heartwarming high-water mark of early screen comedy."
"Set against a rich evocation of postwar London’s East End Jewish quarter, Carol Reed’s touchingly bittersweet Technicolor fable concerns a young boy (Jonathan Ashmore) who comes into possession of a curiously-horned goat he believes to be a unicorn with the power to grant wishes. And then, miraculously, the dreams of those around him really do seem to come true . . . Mixing poetic neorealism with child’s-eye fantasy, Reed crafts a delicately moving ode to the power of belief."
"Eleven-year-old Cyril (Thomas Doret), all coiled anger and furious motion, is living in a group home but refuses to believe he has been rejected by his single father (Jérémie Renier). He spends his days frantically trying to reach the man, over the phone or on his beloved bicycle. It is only the patience and compassion of Samantha (Cécile de France), the stranger who agrees to care for him, that offers the boy the chance to move on. Spare and unsentimental but deeply imbued with a heart-rending tenderness, THE KID WITH A BIKE is an arresting work from the great Belgian directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, masters of the empathetic action film."
"In this pitch-black action comedy by Kihachi Okamoto, a pair of down-on-their-luck swordsmen arrive in a dusty, windblown town, where they become involved in a local clan dispute. One, previously a farmer, longs to become a noble samurai. The other, a former samurai haunted by his past, prefers living anonymously with gangsters. But when both men discover the wrongdoings of the nefarious clan leader, they side with a band of rebels who are under siege at a remote mountain cabin. Based on the same source novel as Akira Kurosawa’s SANJURO, KILL! playfully tweaks samurai film convention, borrowing elements from established chanbara classics and seasoning them with a little Italian western."
"Ernest Hemingway’s gripping short story “The Killers” has fascinated readers and filmmakers for generations. In 1964, Don Siegel—initially slated to direct the 1946 version—took it on, creating the first-ever made-for-TV feature, which would prove too violent for American audiences in the wake of JFK's assassination."
"Ernest Hemingway’s gripping short story “The Killers” has fascinated readers and filmmakers for generations. Its first screen incarnation came in 1946, when director Robert Siodmak unleashed THE KILLERS, helping to define the film noir style and launching the careers of Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner in this archetypal masterpiece"
A team of hired killers target a young journalist--and only another killer can save her! Directed by Masahiro Shinoda.
"THE KILLERS was Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky’s first film, codirected with his classmates Alexander Gordon and Mirka Beiku in the autumn of 1956 at the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK)."
"The first feature for which celebrated international auteur Yorgos Lanthimos received solo directorial credit, KINETTA takes place in a desolate Greek resort town where three tenuously connected people are linked by mysterious, unsettling impulses. A plainclothes cop pursues triple passions for cars, tape recorders, and Russian women; a lonely, lovesick clerk works as a part-time photographer; and a hotel maid aspires to be an actor through unconventional methods. Darkly comic and insinuatingly hypnotic, this tantalizingly cryptic puzzle film finds Lanthimos first working through the themes of power and control that he would explore to increasing renown in art-house sensations like DOGTOOTH, THE LOBSTER, and THE FAVOURITE."
"When the deposed European King Shadov (Charlie Chaplin) arrives in New York as a new exile, he realizes he must earn a living and accidentally discovers that television commercials afford him the opportunity to do just that. But he also discovers that lurking beneath the seeming free-wheeling American commercialism in the 1950s is a grim mean-spiritedness that threatens to crush the most innocent of its citizens along with its perceived 'enemies.'"
"THE KING OF KINGS is the Greatest Story Ever Told as only Cecil B. DeMille could tell it. In 1927, working with one of the biggest budgets in Hollywood history, DeMille spun the life and Passion of Christ into a silent-era blockbuster. Featuring text drawn directly from the Bible, a cast of thousands, and the great showman’s singular cinematic bag of tricks, THE KING OF KINGS is at once spectacular and deeply reverent, part Gospel, part Technicolor epic."
"A roving film projector repairman (Rüdiger Vogler) saves the life of a depressed psychologist (Hanns Zischler) who has driven his Volkswagen into a river, and they end up on the road together, traveling from one rural German movie theater to another. Along the way, the two men, each running from his past, bond over their shared loneliness. KINGS OF THE ROAD, captured in gorgeous compositions by cinematographer Robby Müller and dedicated to Fritz Lang, is a love letter to the cinema, a moving and funny tale of male friendship, and a portrait of a country still haunted by war."
Allan Quartermain and his team help a woman locate her father and hunt for treasure in Africa.
"It’s a quaint turn-of-the-century small town of shady streets and swimming holes, complete with the Sunday afternoon clip-clop of horse and buggies. But that peaceful exterior conceals human lives twisted by cruelty, murder, and madness. KINGS ROW is one of Warner Bros.’ most distinguished and sensational productions, highlighted by an outstanding cast, haunting James Wong Howe cinematography, and an emotionally charged score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Ann Sheridan, Robert Cummings, Betty Field, Claude Rains, and Charles Coburn give indelible performances, while Ronald Reagan’s portrayal of Drake, a cheerful ne’er-do-well shattered by tragedy, has been hailed as his career best."
"Adapted from Paul Bowles' short story of the same name, KITTY displays Chloë Sevigny's inventive and singular aesthetic in a story about a little girl who dreams of becoming a kitten and finds herself transformed into one."
"Roman Polanski’s first feature is a brilliant psychological thriller that many critics still consider among his greatest work. The story is simple, yet the implications of its characters’ emotions and actions are profound. When a young hitchhiker joins a couple on a weekend yacht trip, psychological warfare breaks out as the two men compete for the woman’s attention. A storm forces the small crew below deck, and tension builds to a violent climax. With stinging dialogue and a mercilessly probing camera, Polanski creates a disturbing study of fear, humiliation, sexuality, and aggression. This remarkable directorial debut won Polanski worldwide acclaim, a place on the cover of “Time,” and his first Oscar nomination."
A British spy tries to get a countess out of the new Soviet Union.
"In 1977, acclaimed director Barbet Schroeder and cinematographer Nestor Almendros entered the universe of the world’s most famous primate to create the captivating documentary KOKO: A TALKING GORILLA. The film introduces us to Koko soon after she was brought from the San Francisco Zoo to Stanford University by Dr. Penny Patterson for a controversial experiment—she would be taught the basics of human communication through American Sign Language. An entertaining, troubling, and still relevant documentary, KOKO: A TALKING GORILLA sheds light on the ongoing ethical and philosophical debates over the individual rights of animals and brings us face-to-face with an amazing gorilla caught in the middle."
"Made concurrently with Agnès Varda’s portrait of Jane Birkin, JANE B. PAR AGNÈS V., KUNG-FU MASTER! is a true family affair, achieving a sense of of lived-in intimacy by casting the actor’s real-life relatives, including daughters Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Doillon, as themselves. Varda and Birkin give the familiar theme of a misunderstood couple searching for a place where their love can survive a provocative twist in this daring romance, in which Birkin (who wrote the story that provided the inspiration for the film) plays a middle-aged woman involved with a fourteen-year-old, video game–obsessed boy (Varda’s son, Mathieu Demy). The taboo relationship plays out with supreme delicacy and restraint, as Varda transforms the explosive premise into a disarmingly tender portrait of a woman’s search for lost youth."
"In this poetic and atmospheric horror fable, set in a village in war-torn medieval Japan, a malevolent spirit has been ripping out the throats of itinerant samurai. When a military hero is sent to dispatch the unseen force, he finds that he must struggle with his own personal demons as well. From Kaneto Shindo, director of the terror classic ONIBABA, KURONEKO (BLACK CAT) is a spectacularly eerie twilight tale with a shocking feminist angle, evoked through ghostly special effects and exquisite cinematography."
"After more than a decade of sober political dramas and socially minded period pieces, the great Japanese director Masaki Kobayashi shifted gears dramatically for this rapturously stylized quartet of ghost stories. Featuring colorfully surreal sets and luminous cinematography, these haunting tales of demonic comeuppance and spiritual trials, adapted from writer Lafcadio Hearn’s collections of Japanese folklore, are existentially frightening and meticulously crafted. This version of KWAIDAN is the original three-hour cut, never before released in the United States."
"One of the first French films to address the issue of collaboration during the German occupation, Louis Malle’s brave and controversial LACOMBE, LUCIEN traces a young peasant’s journey from potential Resistance member to Gestapo recruit. At once the story of a nation and one troubled boy, the film is a disquieting portrait of lost innocence and guilt."
"A bearded kendo champion has difficulty finding a job because his peculiar, conservative ways alienate his more progressive peers. (Presented without score.)"
"Gory revenge is raised to the level of visual poetry in Toshiya Fujita’s stunning LADY SNOWBLOOD. A major inspiration for Quentin Tarantino’s KILL BILL saga, this endlessly inventive film, set in late nineteenth-century Japan, charts the single-minded path of vengeance taken by a young woman (Meiko Kaji) whose parents were the unfortunate victims of a gang of brutal criminals. Fujita creates a wildly entertaining action film of remarkable craft, an effortless balancing act between beauty and violence."
"Meiko Kaji returns in Toshiya Fujita’s invigorating sequel to his own cult hit LADY SNOWBLOOD. Our furious heroine is captured by the authorities and sentenced to death for the various killings she has committed; however, she is offered a chance of escape—if she carries out dangerous orders for the government. More politically minded than the original, LADY SNOWBLOOD: LOVE SONG OF VENGEANCE is full of exciting plot turns and ingenious action sequences."
"In Alfred Hitchcock’s most quick-witted and devilish comic thriller, the beautiful Margaret Lockwood, traveling across Europe by train, meets a charming spinster (Dame May Whitty), who then seems to disappear into thin air. The younger woman turns investigator and finds herself drawn into a complex web of mystery and high adventure. Also starring Michael Redgrave, THE LADY VANISHES remains one of the great filmmaker’s purest delights."

"THE LAMP was made in Roman Polanski's final year at the State Film School in Lodz. Polanski has said there is a connection between all his short films, 'because in them I had certain ideals which I wished to express. It's really a question of a certain style that appeals to me more than a theme. I like the theater of the absurd. I also like surrealism. Often I have used a form close to surrealism in order to express a certain idea or thought.'"
"Margaret Tait follows her neighbor Mary Graham Sinclair, a poet (or “makar”) of the land, through the seasons as she works her farm."
"Pierre Etaix's most radical film, and perhaps unsurprisingly the one that effectively ended his career in cinema, LAND OF MILK AND HONEY is a fascinating investigative documentary about post-May ’68 French society. In it, Etaix trains his discerning eye on idle summer vacationers, but the film has bigger fish to fry, asking pertinent questions about the sexualization of culture, class and gender inequality, media and advertising, and even architecture."
"Henri Langlois, the legendary cofounder of the Cinémathèque Française, changed the course of cinema history with his passionate advocacy for film culture, helping incubate the artistic explosion of the French New Wave. When the French government attempted to close down the Cinémathèque in 1968, Langlois’s movie mecca became a rallying point for the student protest movement that would soon bring France to the brink of revolution—and shut down that year’s Cannes Film Festival. Made two years later, this documentary portrait follows Langlois around the streets of Paris and features interviews with Lilian Gish, Simone Signoret, Catherine Deneuve, Kenneth Anger, Viva, and more. "
"Told by his doctor he has no more than a few months to live, drab British workingman George Bird (Alec Guinness) decides to spend his savings on lodging at a seaside resort. Once there, however, he finds his identity caught between upstairs and downstairs, the guests and the “help.” A droll social commentary as well as an unpredictable dark comedy about life, death, and luck, LAST HOLIDAY is one of Guinness’s finest moments."
"With this tale of two swordsmen who team up on a mission of revenge, John Woo attempted to revive the moribund wuxia genre. A flop at the time of its release, this early work has since been recognized as an artistic breakthrough in the Hong Kong action maestro’s career. Though the period trappings and swordplay set LAST HURRAH FOR CHIVALRY apart from Woo’s most famous films, the gorgeously stylized violence, graceful camera motion, and thematic emphasis on a code of honor among men laid the course for his bullet ballets A BETTER TOMORROW and THE KILLER."
"Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star as members of a French theater company living under the German occupation during World War II in François Truffaut’s gripping, humanist character study. Against all odds—a Jewish theater manager in hiding; a leading man who’s in the Resistance; increasingly restrictive Nazi oversight—the troupe believes the show must go on. Equal parts romance, historical tragedy, and even comedy, THE LAST METRO (LE DERNIER MÉTRO) is Truffaut’s ultimate tribute to art overcoming adversity."
"Richard Chamberlain stars as Australian lawyer David Burton, who takes on the defense of a group of aborigines accused of killing one of their own. He suspects the victim has been killed for violating a tribal taboo, but the defendants deny any tribal association. Burton, plagued by apocalyptic visions of water, slowly realizes his own involvement with the aborigines . . . and their prophecies."
The great actress and Ozu regular Setsuko Hara plays a mother gently trying to persuade her daughter to marry in this glowing portrait of family love and conflict; a reworking of Ozu's 1949 masterpiece Late Spring.
"As one might infer from its title, Mikio Naruse’s LATE CHRYSANTHEMUMS (1954) is a very autumnal film, laced with nostalgia and sadness for its characters—Haruko Sugimura (FLOATING WEEDS, TOKYO STORY) portrays Kin, a former geisha who has parlayed her earnings at her one-time profession into work as a moneylender; but most of her clients are ex-colleagues of hers, and their lives are not what they once were, nor do any of them have much real chance for happiness. As with many of Naruse’s other films, the focus is on the limitations and gradual constriction of the lives open to women, especially as time preys on their one usual asset, their appearance."
"One of the most powerful of Yasujiro Ozu’s family portraits, LATE SPRING (BANSHUN) tells the story of a widowed father who feels compelled to marry off his beloved only daughter. Eminent Ozu players Chishu Ryu and Setsuko Hara command this poignant tale of love and loss in postwar Japan, which remains as potent today as ever, and a strong justification for its maker’s inclusion in the pantheon of cinema’s greatest directors."
"Set along the Turkish-Syrian frontier, this terse, elemental tale of smugglers contending with a changing social landscape brought together two giants of Turkish cinema. Director Lütfi Ö. Akad had already made some of his country’s most notable films when he was approached by Yılmaz Güney—a rising action star who would become Turkey’s most important and controversial filmmaker—to collaborate on this neo-western about a quiet man who finds himself pitted against his fellow outlaws. Combining documentary authenticity with a tough, lean poetry, LAW OF THE BORDER transformed the nation’s cinema forever—even though it was virtually impossible to see for many years."
The music video for 'L.A. Woman' by the Leningrad Cowboys.
"A less-than-scrupulous assistant district attorney gets the chance to regain his conscience in this briskly entertaining tale of corruption and redemption. Anton Adam (William Powell) is more interested in furthering his career than justice, but his errors finally catch up to him when he becomes the subject of a blackmail scheme, then barely escapes going to prison himself. As Adam attempts to rebuild his life and legal practice, he can count on only one person: his loyal secretary (Joan Blondell), who just so happens to be with in love with him."
"Bitter about being forced into retirement, a colonel (wittily embodied by Jack Hawkins) ropes a cadre of former British army men into aiding him in a one-million-pound bank robbery, a risky, multitiered plan that involves infiltrating a military compound. A delightful cast of British all-stars, including Richard Attenborough, Bryan Forbes, and Roger Livesey, brings to life this precisely calibrated caper, which was immensely popular and influenced countless Hollywood heist films."
"Volker Schlöndorff delves into the fractured political climate of 1970s East and West Germany in this remarkably nuanced historical drama. Rita Vogt (Bibiana Beglau) is a fugitive West German political terrorist whose hatred of capitalism and fervent belief in communism leads her to settle in East Germany under a new name—until reunification threatens to expose her true identity. Inspired by the story of real-life radical Inge Viett, THE LEGEND OF RITA is a potent study of the human cost of Germany’s division from one of the country’s most astute political filmmakers."
A young woman fends off a series of aggressive marriage proposals from a man who committed atrocities during World War II. Keisuke Kinoshita directs.
"LEMON was often exhibited as an installation in museums and galleries, where it would play on a continuous loop. "
"A struggling Siberian rock band leaves the lonely tundra to tour the United States because, as they're told, ""they'll buy anything there."" Aki Kaurismäki's winningly aloof farce follows the musicians as they bravely make their way across the New World, carrying a bandmate (and some beer) in a coffin and sporting hairdos that resemble unicorn horns. LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA was such a sensation that it brought the fictional band a major real-life following."
"Living in Mexico with a top-ten hit under their belts, the Leningrad Cowboys have fallen on hard times. When they head north to rejoin their manager (Kaurismäki mainstay Matti Pellonpää) for a gig in Coney Island, he has turned into a self-proclaimed prophet who wishes to lead them back to the promised land of Siberia. Like its predecessor, LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA, LENINGRAD COWBOYS MEET MOSES is a road movie, the humorous hardships this time coming from the rocky terrain of the new Europe."
"Dustin Hoffman brilliantly captures the complexities and contradictions of the legendary comedian Lenny Bruce’s mercurial character in this searing, behind-the-scenes portrait from director Bob Fosse. Cutting back and forth in time, LENNY captures the stand-up at both his electrifying prime—when he broke new ground and courted controversy with his outspoken, uncensored style—and his late-career low, when, worn down by his conviction in an obscenity trial, he succumbed to drug addiction. Costar Valerie Perrine received the best actress prize at Cannes for her wrenching performance as Bruce’s wife, Honey."
"In 2001, Lenny Cooke was the most hyped high school basketball player in the country, ranked above future greats LeBron James, Amar’e Stoudemire, and Carmelo Anthony. A decade later, he had never played a minute in the NBA. This quintessentially American documentary by Josh and Benny Safdie tracks the unfulfilled destiny of a man for whom superstardom was only just out of reach."
"David and Marianne's marriage has become strained, with both parties taking on extramarital affairs. When both of them end up on the same train by coincidence they end up rekindling their lost love."
"Chris Marker's first feature showcases early examples of his ruminations on memory, interpretation and culture while maintaining a sharp sense of wit."
"The great Soviet director Mikhail Kalatozov, known for his virtuosic, emotionally gripping films, perhaps never made a more visually astonishing one than LETTER NEVER SENT. This absorbing tale of exploration and survival concerns the four members of a geological expedition, who are stranded in the bleak and unforgiving Siberian wilderness while on a mission to find diamonds. Luxuriating in wide-angle beauty and featuring one daring shot after another (the brilliant cinematography is by Kalatozov’s frequent collaborator Sergei Urusevsky), LETTER NEVER SENT is a fascinating piece of cinematic history and a universal adventure of the highest order."
"Soon after completing TOUT VA BIEN, actor Jane Fonda returned to her political activism and visited North Vietnam. The appearance of the “Hanoi Jane” photograph in the French magazine “L’Express” inspired filmmakers Jean-Pierre Gorin and Jean-Luc Godard to create the following investigative film, LETTER TO JANE (1972)."
"A deceptive lightness distinguishes this farcical second feature made by Claude Autant-Lara while Germany occupied France. During the reign of Napoléon III, a plucky businesswoman (Odette Joyeux) agrees to receive love letters to a prefect's wife from a young official, and soon finds herself embroiled in a scandal that inflames a town's class tensions. A transporting period piece with ornate costumes by Christian Dior, LETTRES D'AMOUR paints a blithely pointed portrait of life in a highly stratified society."

"Sofia Coppola made the following 16 mm short film in 1998, the same year she began production on THE VIRGIN SUICIDES."
"Considered by many to be the finest British film ever made, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP, by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, is a stirring masterpiece like no other. Roger Livesey dynamically embodies outmoded English militarism as the indelible General Clive Candy, who barely survives four decades of tumultuous British history, 1902 to 1942, only to see the world change irrevocably before his eyes. Anton Walbrook and Deborah Kerr provide unforgettable support, he as a German enemy turned lifelong friend of Candy’s and she as young women of three consecutive generations, a socially committed governess, a sweet-souled war nurse, and a modern-thinking army driver, who inspire him. COLONEL BLIMP is both moving and slyly satirical, an incomparable film about war, love, aging, and obsolescence, shot in gorgeous Technicolor."
"Uncle Luke changes the face of hip-hop, is elected mayor of Miami and survives a nuclear meltdown."
"In LIFE DURING WARTIME, independent filmmaker Todd Solondz explores contemporary American existence and the nature of forgiveness with his customary dry humor and queasy precision. The film functions as a distorted mirror image of Solondz’s acclaimed 1998 dark comedy HAPPINESS, its emotionally stunted characters now groping for the possibility of change in a post-9/11 world. HAPPINESS’s grim New Jersey setting is transposed mainly to sunny Florida, but the biggest twist is that new actors fill the roles from the earlier film—including Shirley Henderson, Allison Janney, and Ally Sheedy as alarmingly dissimilar sisters, and Ciarán Hinds hauntingly embodying a reformed pedophile. Shot in expressionistic tones by cinematographer extraordinaire Ed Lachman, Solondz’s film finds the humor in the tragic and the tragic in the everyday."
"This invigorating film from Mike Leigh was his first international sensation. Melancholy and funny by turns, it is an intimate portrait of a working-class family in a suburb just north of London—an irrepressible mum and dad (Alison Steadman and Jim Broadbent) and their night-and-day twins, a bookish good girl and a troubled, ill-tempered layabout (Claire Skinner and Jane Horrocks). Leigh and his typically brilliant cast create, with extraordinary sensitivity and craft, a vivid, lived-in story of ordinary existence, in which even modest dreams—such as the father’s desire to open a food truck—carry enormous weight."
"A peerless chronicler of the soul who specialized in supremely emotional, visually exquisite films about the circumstances of women in Japanese society, Kenji Mizoguchi had already been directing movies for decades when he made THE LIFE OF OHARU in 1952. But this epic portrait of an inexorable fall from grace, starring the astounding Kinuyo Tanaka as an imperial lady-in-waiting who gradually descends to street prostitution, was the movie that gained the director international attention, ushering in a new golden period for him."
"Since television coverage of the Olympic Games had almost reached saturation point, Bud Greenspan made LILLEHAMMER '94: 16 DAYS OF GLORY to dwell more exclusively on personalities and champions rather than events."
"The leopard shall lie down with the goat, the wolves shall live with the lambs. And the young boy will lead them. 12+1 kids and the carcass of a whale washed ashore..."
"Charlie Chaplin’s masterful drama about the twilight of a former vaudeville star is among the writer-director’s most touching films. Chaplin plays Calvero, a once beloved musical-comedy performer, now a washed-up alcoholic who lives in a small London flat. A glimmer of hope arrives when he meets a beautiful but melancholy ballerina (Claire Bloom) who lives downstairs. An elegant mix of the comic and the tragic, this poignant movie also features Buster Keaton in an extended cameo, marking the only time the two silent comedy icons appeared in a film together. Made at a time when Chaplin was under attack by the American press and far right, LIMELIGHT was scarcely distributed in the United States upon its initial release, but it is now considered one of his essential and most personal works."
"An astonishing creation, LIMITE is the only feature by the Brazilian director and author Mário Peixoto, made when he was just twenty-two years old. Inspired by a haunting André Kertész photograph on the cover of a French magazine, this avant-garde silent master­piece centers on a man and two women lost at sea, their pasts unfolding through flashbacks propelled by the music of Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, and others. An early work of independent Latin American filmmaking, LIMITE was famously difficult to see for most of the twentieth century. It is a pioneering achievement that continues to captivate with its timeless visual poetry."
"This early, influential propaganda film blends documentary and studio footage to show the valiant efforts of the Royal Air Force to defend the British people against the Nazi invasion."
"Agnès Varda brings New York counterculture to Los Angeles. In a rented house in the sun-soaked Hollywood Hills, a woman and two men, Viva, of Warhol Factory fame, and James Rado and Gerome Ragni, who created and starred in the rock musical “Hair,” delight in one another's bodies while musing on love, stardom, and politics. They are soon joined by underground director Shirley Clarke, playing herself as well as functioning as a surrogate for Varda. LIONS LOVE (...AND LIES) is a metacinematic inquiry into the alternating currents of whimsy and tragedy that typified late-sixties America."
"Rom-com meets documentary in this charming hybrid that unfolds in the shadow of the regal Lion of Belfort, the sculptural mascot of Paris’s 14th arrondissement, where Agnès Varda lived most of her life."
A semi-psychedelic collection of different liquids crystalizing under a microscope.
"As the end of her life approaches, an old woman encounters a strange spirit from a nearby forest."
An Arab woman fleeing her abusive husband seeks refuge in a Danish police station—but her plight is soon lost in translation.
"One of the most influential and enchanting films of the American independent cinema, this charming, stylistically innovative fable poetically captures the joys and wonders of childhood. When seven-year-old Joey (Richie Andrusco) is tricked into believing he has killed his older brother, he gathers his meager possessions and flees to New York’s nether wonderland: Coney Island. Upon and beneath the crowded boardwalk, Joey experiences a day and night filled with adventures and mysteries, captured in a groundbreaking, semidocumentary style that is refreshingly spontaneous and thoroughly delightful. Winner of the Silver Lion at the 1953 Venice Film Festival, LITTLE FUGITIVE bursts with a freewheeling inventiveness that would go on to influence both the French New Wave (particularly François Truffaut, who cited it as a key reference for THE 400 BLOWS) and a generation of DIY American filmmakers."
"The definitive screen adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s classic, oft-filmed rags-to-riches tale follows the fortunes of the young Ceddie (the delightful Freddie Bartholomew), a precocious boy being raised by his single mother (Dolores Costello) in late-nineteenth-century Brooklyn. When he discovers that he is the heir of a British earl and is sent to England to live with his aristocratic grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith)—who despises the boy’s common mother—Ceddie must win over the old man in order to unite his family. Produced with characteristic meticulousness by the legendary David O. Selznick and costarring a young Mickey Rooney, LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY is a heartwarming childhood fantasy."
"Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s internationally beloved philosophical fable receives a touchingly sincere, imaginative musical adaptation courtesy of three giants of the form: director Stanley Donen and legendary songwriting team Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe. Filmed on location in Tunisia, THE LITTLE PRINCE brings to life Saint-Exupéry’s deceptively simple tale of an encounter between a pilot (Richard Kiley) who has made an emergency landing in the Sahara Desert and a young, blonde-haired prince (Steven Warner), an intergalactic traveler from the Asteroid B-612 whose observations on life on Earth offer poignant insight into the human condition. The illustrious supporting cast includes Bob Fosse as the Snake, Gene Wilder as the Fox, and Donna McKechnie as the Rose."
"Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman met in 1965 during the filming of Persona. Both were married, and there was a difference in age: Liv was 25, and Ingmar was 47. But none of it mattered. They lived together for five years, had a child, and made 11 films together. Now, nearly 5 decades later, Ingmar is gone ... but their bond remains. Told entirely from Liv's point-of-view through an interview filmed at the house she shared with Bergman, Liv and Ingmar brings together excerpts from their films, still photos, behind-the-scenes footage, and personal letters to tell the tale of two great artists who were also human beings, lovers, and friends."
"A gay THELMA & LOUISE for the New Queer Cinema movement, Gregg Araki’s couple-on-the-run romance follows two HIV-positive lovers—hustler Luke (Mike Dytri) and film critic Jon (Craig Gilmore)—who, with nothing left to lose, embark on a violent cross-country crime spree, with homophobes as their primary target. Laced with savage humor, THE LIVING END channels the hopelessness felt by gay people during the AIDS crisis into an explosion of undiluted existential fury."
"A superstitious farming family is hesitant to use its fields to grow crops to help feed the nation's troops. Keisuke Kinoshita's rural drama was made to promote the war effort, but his story branches off in many directions, including one subplot about the family's heirloom samurai sword and another about a blossoming young romance."
"In this atmospheric tale of revenge from beyond the watery grave, a pirate-ransacked freighter's violent past comes back to haunt a young woman living in a seaside town. Mixing elements of kaidan (ghost stories), doppelgaÃànger thrillers, and mad-scientist movies, Hiroshi Matsuno's The Living Skeleton is a wild and eerie work, with beautiful widescreen, black-and-white cinematography."
"Stephanie Saint Sanchez offers a comedic, revisionist retelling of the story of the legendary “weeping woman” of Mexican folklore."
"With his third feature film, THE LODGER: A STORY OF THE LONDON FOG, Alfred Hitchcock took a major step toward greatness and made what he would come to consider his true directorial debut. This haunting silent thriller tells the tale of a mysterious young man (matinee idol Ivor Novello) who takes up residence at a London boardinghouse just as a killer known as the Avenger descends upon the city, preying on blonde women. The film is animated by the palpable energy of a young stylist at play, decisively establishing the director’s formal and thematic obsessions. "
"Spectacular car chases, an intense hostage crisis, wild animals rampaging through the city, and even more in LOGORAMA!"
"Germany in the autumn of 1957: Lola (Barbara Sukowa), a seductive cabaret singer–prostitute, exults in her power as a tempter of men, but she wants more—money, property, and love. Pitting a corrupt building contractor (Mario Adorf) against the new straight-arrow building commissioner (Armin Mueller-Stahl), Lola launches an outrageous plan to elevate herself in a world where everything—and everyone—is for sale. Shot in childlike candy colors, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s LOLA, an homage to Josef von Sternberg’s classic THE BLUE ANGEL, is a wonderfully satirical tribute to capitalism."
"Jacques Demy’s crystalline debut gave birth to the fictional universe in which so many of his characters would live, play, and love. It’s among his most profoundly felt films, a tale of crisscrossing lives in Nantes (Demy’s hometown) that floats on waves of longing and desire. Heading the film’s ensemble is the enchanting Anouk Aimée as the title character, a cabaret chanteuse who’s awaiting the return of a long-lost lover and unwilling to entertain the adoration of another love-struck soul, the wanderer Roland (Marc Michel). Humane, wistful, and witty, LOLA is a testament to the resilience of the heartbroken."
"LOLA MONTÈS is a visually ravishing, narratively daring dramatization of the life of the notorious courtesan and showgirl, played by Martine Carol. With his customary cinematographic flourish and, for the first time, vibrant color, Max Ophuls charts the course of Montès’s scandalous past through the invocations of the bombastic ringmaster (Peter Ustinov) of the American circus where she has ended up performing. Ophuls’s final film, LOLA MONTÈS is at once a magnificent romantic melodrama, a meditation on the lurid fascination with celebrity, and a one-of-a-kind movie spectacle."
The writings and movie memories of renowned poet John Ashbery are refracted in a kaleidoscope of film clips that open up an illuminating dialogue between his work and cinema.
Maggie Smith plays an older woman who begins to lose her faith in the church as the loneliness of her existence comes to bear.
"In this exploitation-cinema classic, which took the action and graphic violence of the LONE WOLF AND CUB series to delirious new heights, Itto Ogami and Daigoro continue their quest for vengeance through meifumado, the spiritual way of “demons and damnation,” pursued constantly by the Shadow Yagyu clan and the shogun's spies."
"In this distinctly lowbrow entry in the LONE WOLF AND CUB series, Itto Ogami is hired by the Owari clan to assassinate a tattooed woman who is killing her enemies and cutting off their topknots. Meanwhile, Daigoro is separated from his father when he follows a pair of traveling street performers outside of town."
"Balancing physical action with Buddhist musings on life and death, the most spiritual of the LONE WOLF AND CUB films finds Ogami's combat skills put to the test by five different warrior-messengers."
"Unfolding in an idyllic countryside that contrasts sharply with the violence that occurs within it, the third LONE WOLF AND CUB film follows Itto Ogami and Daigoro as they continue their journey and stumble upon a crime scene involving a group of lowlife swordsmen from the watari-kashi class."
"The inaugural film in the LONE WOLF AND CUB series immediately thrust Itto Ogami into the ranks of the all-time great samurai movie icons. In this installment, the Shadow Yagyu clan plots to solidify its power by taking Ogami's coveted position of shogun's executioner for its own. The legendary assassin escapes with his infant son, Daigoro, and swears vengeance."
"In the final LONE WOLF AND CUB film, star Tomisaburo Wakayama decided to make the sort of wild movie he'd always wanted to: one in which Lone Wolf battles zombies and Daigoro's baby cart zips improbably across an icy landscape on skis."
"THE LONG DAY CLOSES is the most gloriously cinematic expression of the unique sensibility of Terence Davies, widely celebrated as Britain’s greatest living filmmaker. Suffused with both enchantment and melancholy, this autobiographical film takes on the perspective of a quiet, lonely boy growing up in Liverpool in the 1950s. But rather than employ a straightforward narrative, Davies jumps in and out of time, swoops into fantasies and fears, summons memories and dreams. A singular filmic tapestry, THE LONG DAY CLOSES is an evocative, movie- and music-besotted portrait of the artist as a young man."
"Bi Gan’s dazzling sophomore feature is a hallucinatory, noir-tinged stunner about a lost soul (Huang Jue) on a quest to find a missing woman from his past (Tang Wei). Following leads across Guizhou province, he crosses paths with a series of colorful characters, among them a prickly hairdresser played by Taiwanese superstar Sylvia Chang. When the search leads him to a dingy movie theater, the film launches him—and us—into an epic, gravity-defying sequence, an immersive, hour-long odyssey through a labyrinthine dreamscape that ranks as one of the true marvels of modern cinema. China’s biggest art-house hit of all time, LONG DAY’S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT confirms Bi as one the most daring and exciting auteurs working today."
"Bob Hoskins, in his breakthrough film role, stars as a London racketeer fast losing control of his gangland empire; Helen Mirren shines as his classy moll. John Mackenzie’s stylish thriller is a marriage of gangster flicks from both sides of the Atlantic."
"A middle aged man comes home to find his mother floating dead in a swimming pool. With the help of his brother, he attempts to hide the body so as to not interrupt his upcoming wedding."
"On the long voyage home from the West Indies to Baltimore and then to England, the British tramp steamer the Glencairn takes aboard a cargo of munitions, a circumstance which turns the natural complaining of the crew into a case of genuine fear. Those fears are realized when a heavy gale tests the mettle of the ship and in the storm, mountainous waves hurtle the sailor Yank to the seething deck, thus bringing him to his death as his shipmates, Ole Olson and Driscoll, watch helplessly."
"Nature fights back in a tense, terrifying Ozploitation classic with an urgent ecological message. Attempting to resurrect their failing marriage, Peter (John Hargreaves) and Marcia (Briony Behets) set out on a camping trip to a deserted stretch of the Australian coastline in the hopes that a long weekend in the sunshine will help patch up their differences. They trample through the countryside, destroying everything in their tracks, carelessly scattering garbage, and shooting anything that moves. The pair’s callous disregard for the environment soon comes back to haunt them when the animals whose home they have disrespected retaliate, leaving the wanton destroyers to face their own potential annihilation."
"Jimmy Porter (Richard Burton) is a university graduate, and the husband of a woman of some means, but he has rejected middle class dreams, and operates a candy stall at the local flea market. During their two year marriage, Allyson (Mary Ure) has carried the full brunt of Jimmy's anger and frustration, as well as his intense love. As time goes on, he becomes more and more bitter, ridiculing Allyson about her middle class background. Allyson defends herself as best she can, but her husband so intimidates her that she can't even bring herself to tell him that she is pregnant. Everything comes to a head when Allyson's friend Helena Charles (Claire Bloom), an actress, moves in with them for awhile. She becomes witness to the turbulent relationship and the toll it is taking. When she learns about the pregnancy, she persuades Allyson to leave Jimmy and return to her parents, allowing time for the relationships to complicate even further."
"In the hands of the renowned experimental theater director Peter Brook, William Golding’s legendary novel about the primitivism lurking beneath civilization becomes a film as raw and ragged as the lost boys at its center. Taking an innovative documentary-like approach, Brook shot LORD OF THE FLIES with an off-the-cuff naturalism, seeming to record a spontaneous eruption of its characters’ ids. The result is a rattling masterpiece, as provocative as its source material."
"One of the first feature films directed by an African American woman, Kathleen Collins’s LOSING GROUND tells the story of a marriage between two remarkable people, both at a crossroads in their lives. Sara Rogers (Seret Scott), a black professor of philosophy, is embarking on an intellectual quest to understand “ecstasy” just as her painter husband, Victor (Bill Gunn), sets off on a more earthy exploration of joy. Over the course of a summer idyll in upstate New York, the two each experience profound emotional and romantic awakenings. Applying a deft comic touch to a deeply personal exploration of love, race, and gender, Collins crafts a charming, complex tale of personal discovery that, after decades of neglect, has reemerged as a still-fresh landmark of independent cinema."
"When a young woman spends the night with an alleged terrorist, her quiet, ordered life falls into ruins. THE LOST HONOR OF KATHARINA BLUM portrays an anxious era in West Germany amid a crumbling postwar political consensus. Katharina, though apparently innocent, suddenly becomes a suspect, falling prey to a vicious smear campaign by the police and a ruthless tabloid journalist that tests the limits of her dignity and her sanity. Crafting one of the most accessible and direct works of 1970s political filmmaking, Volker Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta deliver a powerful adaptation of Heinrich Böll’s novel, a stinging commentary on state power, individual freedom, and media manipulation that is as relevant today as when it was released."
"In this hysterical satire of Reagan-era values, written and directed by Albert Brooks, a successful Los Angeles advertising executive (Brooks) and his wife (Julie Hagerty) decide to quit their jobs, buy a Winnebago, and follow their EASY RIDER fantasies of freedom and the open road. When a stop in Las Vegas nearly derails their plans, they’re forced to come to terms with their own limitations and those of the American dream. Brooks’s barbed wit and confident direction drive LOST IN AMERICA, an iconic example of his restless comedies about insecure characters searching for satisfaction in the modern world that established his unique comic voice and transformed the art of observational humor."
The following is a short film created in 2012 by director Guy Maddin.
"A young Isabelle Huppert and Gérard Depardieu make for one of the most breathtaking screen couples in French-cinema history in this raw, sexy, messy tale of amour fou. Huppert is Nelly, a well-to-do woman who chucks her comfortable but dull marriage for a fling with Depardieu’s bad-boy petty criminal Loulou, who introduces her to the allure of the gutter. A fearless exploration of sexual liberation and the French class system, LOULOU stands as one of director Maurice Pialat’s riskiest and most startling studies of the volatile unpredictability of human nature."
"In outline, this is the story of the tragic romance between a young telephonist (Eva Ras) and a middle-aged rodent sanitation specialist (Slobodan Aligrudic) in Belgrade. Yet in Dusan Makavejev's manic hands, this second feature becomes an endlessly surprising, time-shifting exploration of love and freedom. Featuring interludes of interviews with a sexologist and a criminologist, as well as some of the most elegant dramatic filmmaking of the director's career, Love Affair, based on a true incident, further demonstrated Makavejev's adeptness at mixing and matching genres, and his odd, sophisticated humanism."
"Saul J. Turell's documentary fixes our gaze on cinema's female sex symbols, delighting in their glamor while also examining our shifting culture that constantly redefines what we consider alluring--and what we are allowed to see."
"Though happily married to the adoring Hélène and expecting a second child with her, the thoroughly bourgeois executive Frédéric cannot banish from his mind the attractive Paris women he sees every day. His flirtations and fantasies remain harmless until the appearance at his office of Chloé, an audacious, unencumbered old flame played by the mesmerizing Zouzou. LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON, the luminous final chapter in Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales, is a tender, sobering, and wholly adult affair that leads to perhaps the most overwhelmingly emotional moment in the entire series."
"For his feature debut, Rainer Werner Fassbinder fashioned an acerbic, unorthodox crime drama about a love triangle involving the small-time pimp Franz (Fassbinder), his prostitute girlfriend, Joanna (future Fassbinder mainstay Hanna Schygulla), and his gangster friend Bruno (Ulli Lommel). With its minimalist tableaux and catalog of New Wave and Hollywood references, this is a stylishly nihilistic cinematic statement of intent."
"The torrid psychosexual world of uncompromising British painter Francis Bacon is brought to terrifying life in this unflinching portrait of the artist as a monster. Bacon (Derek Jacobi) is at the height of his fame in the 1960s when would-be thief George Dyer (Daniel Craig) breaks into his studio. Thus begins a cruel, tumultuous love affair that plays out like a grim hallucination every bit as nightmarish as one of Bacon’s own canvases."
"The first feature by both acclaimed director Kathryn Bigelow and future David Lynch producer Monty Montgomery, as well as the screen debut of star Willem Dafoe, this edgy, should-be cult classic puts a furiously subversive spin on the rebel biker films of the 1950s. Dafoe is the pomade-slicked, leather-clad Vance, whose outlaw motorcycle gang roars into a small Southern town en route to the Daytona races, igniting simmering tensions with the locals and setting the stage for a violent standoff. The air of all-American menace is heightened by the jukebox soundtrack courtesy of costar and neo-rockabilly legend Robert Gordon."
The mating rituals and reproductive cycle of the octopus are the subject of this short documentary by Jean Painlevé.
"A woman brings her injured daughter to the hospital, only to realize that the doctor is the estranged father of her child. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda."
"Antoine Doinel strikes again! In the final chapter of François Truffaut’s saga, we find Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud), now in his thirties, convivially concluding his marriage, enjoying moderate success as a novelist, and clinging to his romantic fantasies. The newly single Doinel finds a new object of his affections in Sabine, a record store salesgirl whom he pursues with the fervid belief that without love, one is nothing. Along the way, he renews his acquaintance with previous loves and confronts his own chaotic past. In LOVE ON THE RUN, Antoine Doinel is still in love and because he’s still in love, he’s still alive."
"Louis Malle unveiled the natural beauty of Jeanne Moreau in his breakthrough, ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS. With his follow-up, the scandalous smash THE LOVERS (LES AMANTS), he made her a star once and for all. A deeply felt and luxuriously filmed fairy tale for grown-ups, perched on the edge between classical and New Wave cinemas, THE LOVERS presents Moreau as a restless bourgeois wife whose eye wanders from both her husband and her lover to an attractive passing stranger (Jean-Marc Bory). Thanks to its frank sexuality, THE LOVERS caused quite a stir, being censored and attacked for obscenity around the world. If today its shock has worn off, its glistening sensuality and seductive storytelling haven’t aged a day."
"With sixteen women to each man, the odds are against Andula in her desperate search for love—that is, until a rakish piano player visits her small factory town and temporarily eases her longings. A tender and humorous look at Andula’s journey, from the first pangs of romance to its inevitable disappointments, LOVES OF A BLONDE immediately became a classic of the Czechoslovak New Wave and earned Milos Forman the first of his Academy Award nominations."
Two teenagers are drawn together by the Buzzcocks' single Love You More during the summer of 1978.
"In Jean Renoir’s lightened adaptation of Maxim Gorky’s play, a thief and a destitute Baron form a friendship as the inhabitants of a Parisian slum go about their lives."
"Jean Renoir and Akira Kurosawa, two of cinema’s greatest directors, transform Maxim Gorky’s classic proletariat play “The Lower Depths” in their own ways for their own times. Renoir, working amidst the rise of Hitler and the Popular Front in France, had need to take license with the dark nature of Gorky’s source material, softening its bleak outlook. Kurosawa, firmly situated in the postwar world, found little reason for hope. He remained faithful to the original with its focus on the conflict between illusion and reality, a theme he would return to over and over again. Working with their most celebrated actors (Gabin with Renoir; Mifune with Kurosawa), each film offers a unique look at cinematic adaptation, where social conditions and filmmaking styles converge to create unique masterpieces."
"A breathtaking vision of Cuban revolutionary history wrought with white-hot intensity by Humberto Solás, this operatic epic tells the story of a changing country through the eyes of three women, each named Lucía. In 1895, she is a tragic noblewoman who inadvertently betrays her country for love during the war of independence. In 1932, she is the daughter of a bourgeois family drawn into the workers’ uprising against the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado. And in the postrevolutionary 1960s, she is a newlywed farm girl fighting against patriarchal oppression. A formally dazzling landmark of postcolonial cinema, LUCÍA is both a senses-stunning visual experience and a fiercely feminist portrait of a society journeying toward liberation."
"A shimmering glass hotel at the top of a remote Provençal mountain provides the setting for a tragicomic tapestry about an obsessive love pentangle, whose principals range from an artist to a hotel manager to a dam worker. Scripted by Jacques Prévert and Pierre Laroche, the film was banned from theaters for the duration of the occupation for its dark portrayal of the hedonistic excesses of the ruling class. Today, it is often singled out as Jean Grémillon's greatest achievement."
"Bette Gordon’s follow-up to her groundbreaking feminist noir VARIETY is a hallucinatory erotic thriller that is no less subversive. Deborah Kara Unger stars as an unnamed hustler who seduces and robs gullible men while crisscrossing the country with her ten-year-old son, Phillip (Eric Lloyd). The curiously possessive boy grows accustomed to this outlaw life on the road, but his world is turned upside-down when his menacing father (Jamey Sheridan) reappears to take his place at the head of the deteriorating family. Suddenly, Phillip’s Oedipal dream turns into a nightmare."
"This genre-defying horror-musical mash-up—the bold debut of Polish director Agnieszka Smoczyńska—follows a pair of carnivorous mermaid sisters drawn ashore to explore life on land in an alternate 1980s Poland. Their tantalizing siren songs and otherworldly auras make them overnight sensations as nightclub singers in the half-glam, half-decrepit world of Smoczyńska’s imagining. The director gives fierce teeth to her viscerally sensual, darkly feminist twist on Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Little Mermaid,” in which the girls’ bond is tested and their survival threatened after one sister falls for a human. A coming-of-age fairy tale with a catchy synth-fueled soundtrack, outrageous song-and-dance numbers, and lavishly grimy sets, THE LURE explores its themes of emerging female sexuality, exploitation, and the compromises of adulthood with savage energy and originality."
"Douglas Sirk brings a surfeit of menacing, fog-shrouded atmosphere to this wonderfully eccentric blend of mystery and comedy. A serial killer is on the loose in London, luring young women into his web through ads placed in the personal column. Scotland Yard’s bait to ensnare the villain is a young American dance-hall girl (Lucille Ball, in one of her finest big screen roles), who encounters a series of likely suspects, including the ever-rakish George Sanders as a sophisticated playboy and a brilliant Boris Karloff as a mad fashion designer."
"The search for a legendary fortune unleashes tragedy in this dark, gripping saga of gold and greed. Glenn Ford is Jacob Walz, a young man determined to track down the fabled Arizona gold mine known as the Lost Dutchman. When his quest leads him into an affair with the duplicitous Julia Thomas (Ida Lupino)—whose pursuit of the treasure has lead her to double-cross her own husband (Gig Young)—the pair become entangled in a twisty, unpredictable web of avarice and deceit."
"Jacques Demy based this 1962 short, made for the omnibus feature THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, on his memories of growing up in Nantes."
A woman spends her whole life holding out against the advances of three men in the hopes that her first love will return to her.
"A simple, haunting musical phrase whistled offscreen tells us that a young girl will be killed. “Who Is the Murderer?” pleads a nearby placard as serial killer Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) closes in on little Elsie Beckmann . . . In his harrowing masterwork M, Fritz Lang merges trenchant social commentary with chilling suspense, creating a panorama of private madness and public hysteria that to this day remains the blueprint for the psychological thriller."
"A demon bestows on a self-righteous working photographer's camera the power to smite from the Earth ""evil-doers"". Naturally, the indignant photographer turns his new weapon on, one by one, his entire village, beginning with the wealthy or illustrious. Soon, the poor he is so supposedly so enamored of become his victims too, so rife with impatience and contempt is he, that the slightest flaw is cause for smiting. Inevitably, he embarks on a task to destroy everyone."
"For his final film, Akira Kurosawa paid tribute to the immensely popular writer and educator Hyakken Uchida, here played by Tatsuo Matsumura. Madadayo is composed of distinct episodes based on Uchida's writings that illustrate the affection and loyalty felt between Uchida and his students. Poignant and elegant, this is an unforgettable farewell from one of the greatest artists the cinema has ever known."
"This stop-motion animated film takes viewers on an exhilarating existential journey into the fully imagined, tactile world of Madame Tutli-Putli. As she travels alone on the night train, weighed down with all her earthly possessions and the ghosts of her past, she faces both the kindness and menace of strangers. Finding herself caught up in a desperate metaphysical adventure, adrift between real and imagined worlds, Madame Tutli-Putli confronts her demons."
A young Scottish woman from a respectable family is tried for the murder of her French lover.
"Fifth graders from across New York City’s public schools journey into the life-changing world of ballroom dancing in this irresistible documentary from Marilyn Agrelo. Told from the always candid, often hilarious perspectives of the kids themselves, MAD HOT BALLROOM traces their journeys from reluctant participants to pint-sized Astaires as they set out to win it all in a citywide competition. Along the way there are trials, tears, life lessons, and, above all, joy—especially when the kids hit the dance floor to strut their stuff."
"Filled with eye-popping stunts and charged with adrenaline, George Miller’s action classic MAD MAX proved wildly influential in its vision of a ruthless postapocalyptic future. Terrorizing innocent civilians while tearing up the streets, a vicious motorcycle gang laughs in the face of a police force hell-bent on stopping them. But they underestimate one officer: Max (Mel Gibson). And when the bikers brutalize Max’s best friend and family, they send him into a mad frenzy that leaves him with only one thing left in the world to live for—revenge!"
"A lurid tale of sex and psychosis, Madonna of the Seven Moons, directed by Arthur Crabtree, is among the wildest of the Gainsborough melodramas. Set in Italy, it begins as a comparatively sedate tale about a respectable, convent-raised woman (Phyllis Calvert) who is haunted by the memory of being raped as a teenager. But when her grown daughter returns from school, her life begins to unravel in monumentally surprising ways."
"This documentary from Les Blank follows the indomitable Gerald ‘The Maestro’ Gaxiola, who turned to a life of prolific art making after years as an aircraft mechanic, traveling salesman, and body builder. While, in Gaxiola’s words, ‘art is a religion, not a business,’ THE MAESTRO: KING OF THE COWBOY ARTISTS is a joyful portrait of an irreverent, outsized life."
"In Alberto Lattuada’s brilliant dark comedy MAFIOSO, auto-factory foreman Nino (Alberto Sordi) takes his proper, modern wife (Norma Bengell) and two blonde daughters from industrial Milan to antiquated, rural Sicily to visit his family and get back in touch with his roots. But Antonio gets more than he bargained for when he discovers some harsh truths about his ancestors—and himself. One of the first Italian films to look frankly at the Mafia, Lattuada’s devastatingly funny character study is equal parts culture-clash farce and existential nightmare."
"Magellan: At the Gates of Death was initially intended to be included in the Magellan Calendar in two parts , Part I: The Red Gate and Part II: The Green Gate. Frampton later subdivided the film further for the Straits of Magellan phase. The first portion of Part I: The Red Gate is presented here."
"This scintillating screen version of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s beloved opera showcases Ingmar Bergman’s deep knowledge of music and gift for expressing it cinematically. Casting some of Europe’s finest soloists—Josef Köstlinger, Ulrik Cold, Håkan Hagegård, and Birgit Nordin among them—the director lovingly recreated the baroque theater of Sweden’s Drottningholm Palace to stage the story of the prince Tamino and his zestful sidekick Papageno, who are sent on a mission to save a beautiful princess from the clutches of evil. A celebration of love and forgiveness that exhibits a profound appreciation for the artifice and spectacle of the theater, THE MAGIC FLUTE is among the most exquisite opera films ever made."
"With THE MAGICIAN, an engaging, brilliantly conceived tale of chicanery that doubles as a symbolic portrait of the artist as a deceiver, Ingmar Bergman proved himself to be one of cinema’s premier illusionists. Max von Sydow stars as Dr. Vogler, a nineteenth-century traveling mesmerist and peddler of potions whose magic is put to the test in Stockholm by the cruel, eminently rational royal medical adviser Dr. Vergérus (Gunnar Björnstrand). The result is a diabolically clever battle of wits that’s both frightening and funny, shot by Gunnar Fischer in rich, gorgeously gothic black and white."
"Based on a novel by Georges Simenon, Jean-Pierre Melville’s idiosyncratic road movie follows a down-on-his-luck boxer (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who, after he takes a job as secretary for a shady millionaire (Charles Vanel), finds himself embroiled in a high-profile fraud case that takes the pair on the run from Paris to New York to New Orleans. Shot on location in the U.S., Melville’s first color film is a fascinating existential meditation on the bonds between men and the landscapes and mythology of America as seen through the eyes of outsiders."
"Orson Welles’s beautiful, nostalgia-suffused second feature—the subject of one of cinema’s greatest missing-footage tragedies—harks back to turn-of-the-twentieth-century Indianapolis, chronicling the inexorable decline of the fortunes of an affluent family. Adapted from an acclaimed Booth Tarkington novel and featuring restlessly inventive camera work and powerful performances from a cast including Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, and Agnes Moorehead, the film traces the rifts deepening within the Amberson clan—at the same time as the forces of progress begin to transform the city they once ruled. Though RKO excised over forty minutes of footage, now lost to history, and added an incongruously upbeat ending, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is an emotionally rich family saga and a masterful elegy for a bygone chapter of American life."
Famed composer Gustav Mahler reflects on the tragedies of his life and failing marriage while traveling by train.
"Over a booze-fueled, increasingly hectic five-day shoot in East Hampton, Norman Mailer and his cast and crew spontaneously unloaded onto film the lurid and loony chronicle of U.S. presidential candidate and filmmaker Norman T. Kingsley debating and attacking his hangers-on and enemies. This gonzo narrative, ""an inkblot test of Mailer's own subconscious"" (Time), becomes something like a documentary on its own making when costar Rip Torn breaks the fourth wall in one of cinema's most alarming on-screen outbursts."
"A ""helping hand"" comes at a high price for a painter named Roland Brissot. Offered a bargain too good to refuse, Brissot accepts a talisman that leads to a yearlong lucky streak, in the end his luck runs out."
"A young provincial in search of adventure stumbles into the subterranean world of sadomasochism when he is implicated in a burglary of a Paris apartment. The apartment’s mistress runs a two-floor operation, all respectability above and a dungeon of punishment-seeking clients below. After the young man becomes her upstairs lover, she finds that the two levels of her carefully controlled existence begin to interfere with each other. Barbet Schroeder’s MAÎTRESSE examines the line between fantasy and reality, decadence and deprivation, and the distance one will go for love."
"Filmed in London in 1941, during the Blitz, Major Barbara emerged from a troubled production to become a major success for George Bernard Shaw and producer-director Gabriel Pascal. Pygmalion's Wendy Hiller returns, this time as one of Shaw's most memorable and controversial characters, Barbara Undershaft, a Salvation Army officer who speaks out against the hypocrisy she believes exists in her Christian charity organization. Rex Harrison, Robert Newton, and Deborah Kerr costar in this merrily satirical morality play."
"THE MAKING OF FANNY AND ALEXANDER is a fascinating look at the creation of a masterpiece. Directed by Ingmar Bergman himself, this feature-length documentary chronicles the methods of one of cinema’s true luminaries as he labors to realize his crowning production. Featuring Bergman at work with m..."
"This lyrical adaptation of the beloved novel by Junichiro Tanizaki was a late-career triumph for director Kon Ichikawa. Structured around the changing of the seasons, THE MAKIOKA SISTERS (SASAME-YUKI) follows the lives of four siblings who have taken on their family’s kimono manufacturing business, in the years leading up to the Pacific War. The two oldest have been married for some time, but according to tradition, the rebellious youngest sister cannot wed until the third, conservative and terribly shy, finds a husband. This graceful study of a family at a turning point in history is a poignant evocation of changing times and fading customs, shot in rich, vivid colors."
"With its low budget and lush black-and-white imagery, Gus Van Sant’s debut feature MALA NOCHE heralded an idiosyncratic, provocative new voice in American independent film. Set in Van Sant’s hometown of Portland, Oregon, the film evokes a world of transient workers, dead-end day-shifters, and bars and seedy apartments bathed in a profound nighttime, as it follows a romantic deadbeat with a wayward crush on a handsome Mexican immigrant. MALA NOCHE was an important prelude to the New Queer Cinema of the nineties and is a fascinating capsule from a time and place that continues to haunt its director’s work."
"MAMMALS was the last of director Roman Polanski’s short films before he bagan to work on his first feature, KNIFE IN THE WATER. It received awards at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen and the Melbourne International Film Festival."
"Anna Magnani is Mamma Roma, a middle-aged prostitute who attempts to extricate herself from her sordid past for the sake of her son. Filmed in the great tradition of Italian neorealism, MAMMA ROMA offers an unflinching look at the struggle for survival in postwar Italy, and highlights director Pier Paolo Pasolini’s lifelong fascination with the marginalized and dispossessed. Though banned upon its release in Italy for obscenity, today MAMMA ROMA remains a classic, featuring a powerhouse performance by one of cinema’s greatest actresses and offering a glimpse at a country’s most controversial director in the process of finding his style."
"Documentary filmmakers André and Rémy have found an ideal subject in Ben. He is witty, sophisticated, intelligent, well liked—and a serial killer. As André and Rémy document Ben’s routines, they become increasingly entwined in his vicious program, sacrificing their objectivity and their morality. Controversial winner of the International Critics’ Prize at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, MAN BITES DOG stunned audiences worldwide with its unflinching imagery and biting satire of media violence."
"With the simplest of concepts and sparest of techniques, Robert Bresson made one of the most suspenseful jailbreak films of all time in A MAN ESCAPED. Based on the account of an imprisoned French Resistance leader, this unbelievably taut and methodical marvel follows the fictional Fontaine’s single-minded pursuit of freedom, detailing the planning and execution of his escape with gripping precision. But Bresson’s film is not merely about process—it’s also a work of intense spirituality and humanity."
"Lino Brocka achieved international acclaim with this candid portrait of 1970s Manila, a breakout example of the more serious-minded filmmaking the director had turned to after building a career on mainstream movies he described as “soaps.” A young fisherman from a provincial village arrives in the capital on a quest to track down his girlfriend, who was lured there with the promise of work and hasn’t been heard from since. In the meantime, he takes a low-wage job at a construction site and witnesses life on the streets, where death strikes without warning, corruption and exploitation are commonplace, and protests hint at escalating civil unrest. Mixing visceral, documentary-like realism with the narrative focus of Hollywood noir and melodrama, MANILA IN THE CLAWS OF LIGHT is a howl of anguish from one of the most celebrated figures in Philippine cinema."
"This tale of treachery put both the Gainsborough melodrama and actor James Mason on the map. The star-to-be plays Lord Rohan, a cruel nobleman who marries the naive and sweet-natured Clarissa (Phyllis Calvert) for the sole purpose of producing an heir; meanwhile, Clarissa's conniving best friend, Hesther (Margaret Lockwood), plots against her for her own nefarious ends. THE MAN IN GREY, directed by Leslie Arliss, was such a box-office success that Gainsborough used it as a template, launching a cycle of increasingly rococo films."
Apocalypse. Two starving kids find a dead body in the ruins . . .
"Man Is Not a Bird is an antic, free-form portrait of the love lives of two less-than-heroic men who labor in a copper factory. For this first feature, following years of making documentaries and experimental shorts, Dusan Makavejev and his crew set up shop in Bor, a mining town in the mountains near Yugoslavia's border with Bulgaria, interviewing the workers in the region and even shooting footage inside the local ore factories. Yet the result is hardly a staid tribute to the working class. Also featuring seductive Milena Dravic, who would go on to star in Makavejev's groundbreaking WR: Mysteries of the Organism, Man Is Not a Bird is one of cinema's most assured and daring debuts."
"Robert J. Flaherty's award-winning MAN OF ARAN uses stunning location photography and brilliant montage editing to build a forceful drama of life on the Aran Islands. Situated among the frequent and violent storms that slam into its barren landscape, the islands are 'three wastes of rock' off the western coast of Ireland. With a small crew, Flaherty spent nearly two years shooting, developing, and assembling footage of the islanders' Herculean efforts to survive in unbearably harsh conditions."
"In one of his last and finest performances, Gary Cooper plays the reformed outlaw Link Jones, who is unwittingly drawn back into his criminal past when his train is held up by his former gang. One of a string of 1950s western masterpieces directed by the great Anthony Mann—whose complex mise-en-scène brought a dark psychological intensity to the genre—MAN OF THE WEST stands as one of the filmmaker’s most monumental works, achieving a rugged grandeur of almost mythic proportions. Among the film’s most famous admirers: Jean-Luc Godard, who named it the best film of 1958."
"In this surrealist noir, a traveling knife salesman (Michael Cera) discovers something sinister behind every door."
"Terje Vigen was living happily on a small Norwegian island with his wife and daughter when the English blockade forces him to leave his home to travel for food. On his way back a ruthless English captain captures Terje and jails him in England. Upon release, he returns home to discover his wife and child have died. Years later that same captain and his family shipwreck on Terje's island and depend on him for survival."
"“The film has the look of a New York loft, a certain overlay of gritty, claustrophobic funk that permeated that whole period. It’s also a formalist’s snapshot album. Those people were friends of mine during a fairly interesting time. We were all lepers, ‘out-of-it,’ or what have you, with the possible exception of Larry Poons.” - Hollis Frampton"
A haberdasher's assistant (Roland Young) experiments with how to best use his newly granted miraculous powers.
"An ordinary British couple vacationing in Switzerland suddenly find themselves embroiled in a case of international intrigue when their daughter is kidnapped by spies plotting a political assassination. This fleet and gripping film is the first of the early thrillers the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, made during the fertile phase of his career spent at the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation. Besides affirming Hitchcock’s genius, it gave the brilliant Peter Lorre his first English-speaking role, as a slithery villain. With its tension and gallows humor, it’s pure Hitchcock, and it set the tone for such films as THE 39 STEPS and THE LADY VANISHES."
"When a man chases down his stolen movie camera, the thief commits suicide by jumping off a building. But after the police take the camera as evidence, it becomes unclear if there was ever a thief in the first place."
"Clint Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) is a “town tamer,” a hired gun who, for a price, will eliminate any outlaws disturbing the peace of a frontier outpost. When his wife (Jan Sterling), exasperated by his violent lifestyle, leaves him, Tollinger rides off into the lawless town of Sheridan City in pursuit of her. As he tries to win back the woman he loves, Tollinger simultaneously faces the greatest gunfighting challenge of his career. Mitchum brings a finely shaded moral ambiguity to his portrayal of a notorious antihero, while debuting helmer (and longtime Orson Welles collaborator) Richard Wilson directs with a feeling for tension and atmosphere."
"This 1919 one-reeler stars Harold Lloyd as one of Bebe Daniels' many suitors, who, after a series of mishaps, ends up running in a local marathon. It is presented here with a new score composed and performed by Gabriel Thibaudeau."
"Carlos Saura's film of the Games of the XXV Olympiad Barcelona 1992 brings a visual flair and humanism that paid excellent tribute to the Games and to the Catalan capital. The title event, the men's marathon, was chosen both as symbol and leitmotif, in part because the race took place in the streets of Barcelona, but also because of the effort and endurance required in this most arduous of Olympic events. Saura was excited at the prospect of delivering a film that would run approximately the same length as the time a men's marathon winner might achieve, hence this director's cut of MARATHON at two hours and ten minutes."
"Odette Joyeux plays Chiffon, a young and offbeat aristocrat who cannot seem to conform to the social conventions of her community."
"Adapting his hit play “Marius” for the screen two years after its stage premiere, Marcel Pagnol turned his inimitable creative energies to the new medium of sound cinema, in a felicitous collaboration with the Hungarian-born director Alexander Korda, soon to be a leading light of British filmmaking. Young Marius and Fanny begin to recognize that their lifelong friendship has blossomed into romance, but their hopes of marriage are left unrealized when Marius cannot overcome his longing to go to sea, against the wishes of his adoring father, César, but with Fanny's selfless encouragement. Pagnol and Korda bring a keening lyricism to this tale of lovers torn between devotion and the restless urge for adventure, a conflict that begins to shape their destinies in ways they could never predict."
"In its native land, František Vláčil’s MARKETA LAZAROVÁ has been hailed as the greatest Czech film ever made; for many U.S. viewers, it will be a revelation. Based on a novel by Vladislav Vančura, this stirring and poetic depiction of a feud between two rival medieval clans is a fierce, epic, and meticulously designed evocation of the clashes between Christianity and paganism, humankind and nature, love and violence. Vláčil’s approach was to re-create the textures and mentalities of a long-ago way of life, rather than to make a conventional historical drama, and the result is dazzling. With its inventive widescreen cinematography, editing, and sound design, MARKETA LAZAROVÁ is an experimental action film."
"Maria (Hanna Schygulla) marries Hermann Braun in the last days of World War II, only for him to go missing in the war. Alone, Maria puts to use her beauty and ambition in order to find prosperity during Germany’s “economic miracle” of the 1950s. Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s biggest international box-office success, THE MARRIAGE OF MARIA BRAUN is a heartbreaking study of a woman picking herself up from the ruins of her own life, as well as a pointed metaphorical attack on a society determined to forget its past."
"Billy and Antoinette Edwards let it all hang out for Allan King and crew in this jaw-dropping examination of a marriage in trouble, which ""makes John Cassavetes's Faces look like early Doris Day"" (Time). Intense and hectic, frightening and funny, A Married Couple is ultimately a film about the eternal power struggle in romantic relationships, as well as a document of the moment when entrenched gender roles began to crumble."
"This short documentary about the Marseille harbor was produced by filmmaker Marcel Pagnol in 1935, possibly to accompany the release of CÉSAR. An example of the prewar French genre known as “documentaire romance,” the film features several of Pagnol’s regular collaborators. This rare footage is presented here from the best available source."
"One of Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s first forays into the classic melodrama style of his hero Douglas Sirk is a brilliantly perverse, operatically stylized portrait of a woman (Margit Carstensen) caught in a strange, sadomasochistic relationship with a monstrous husband (Karlheinz Böhm), whom she begins to suspect may be trying to murder her. Loosely based on a story by pulp-fiction master Cornell Woolrich, MARTHA finds Fassbinder tearing the institution of marriage to shreds with savage, subversive glee."
"With MASCULIN FÉMININ, ruthless stylist and iconoclast Jean-Luc Godard introduces the world to “the children of Marx and Coca-Cola,” through a gang of restless youths engaged in hopeless love affairs with music, revolution, and each other. French new wave icon Jean-Pierre Leaud stars as Paul, an idealistic would-be intellectual struggling to forge a relationship with the adorable pop star Madeleine (real-life yé-yé girl Chantal Goya). Through their tempestuous affair, Godard fashions a candid and wildly funny free-form examination of youth culture in throbbing 1960s Paris, mixing satire and tragedy as only Godard can."
"Posing as a journalist, a man interviews a celebrity he thinks is responsible for his sister's disappearance."
"A pair of blind masseurs, an enigmatic city woman, a lonely man and his ill-behaved nephew, THE MASSEURS AND A WOMAN is made up of crisscrossing miniature studies of love and family at a remote resort in the mountains. With delicate and surprising humor, Hiroshi Shimizu paints a timeless portrait of loneliness and the human need to connect."
"Twenty years after their brilliant cinema-theater experiment VANYA ON 42ND STREET, Wallace Shawn and André Gregory reunited to produce another idiosyncratic film version of a classic play, this time Henrik Ibsen’s “Bygmester Solness” (“Master Builder Solness”). Brought pristinely to the screen by Jonathan Demme, this compellingly abstract reimagining features Shawn (who also wrote the adaptation) as a visionary but tyrannical middle-aged architect haunted by figures from his past, most acutely an attractive, vivacious young woman (the breathtaking newcomer Lisa Joyce) who has appeared on his doorstep. Also featuring standout supporting performances by Julie Hagerty, Larry Pine, and Gregory, A MASTER BUILDER, like VANYA, is the result of many years of rehearsals, a living, breathing, constantly shifting work that unites theater, film, and dream."
"Before he turned to the story of Joan of Arc, the Danish cinema genius Carl Theodor Dreyer fashioned this ahead-of-its-time examination of domestic life. A deft comedy of gentle revenge, it is the story of a housewife who, with the help of a wily nanny, turns the tables on her tyrannical husband. In it, Dreyer combines lightness and humor with his customary meticulous craft and sense of integrity. MASTER OF THE HOUSE, an enormous box-office success in its day, is a jewel of the silent cinema."
"Kaurismäki took his penchant for despairing character studies to unspeakably grim depths in the shockingly entertaining The Match Factory Girl. Kati Outinen is memorably impenetrable as Iris, whose grinding days as a cog in a factory wheel, and nights as a neglected daughter living with her parents, ultimately send her over the edge. Yet despite her transgressions, Kaurismäki makes Iris a compelling, even sympathetic figure. Bleak yet suffused with comic irony, The Match Factory Girl closes out the ""Proletariat Trilogy"" with a bang, and a whimper."
"James Ivory’s sumptuously romantic adaptation of E. M. Forster’s posthumously published novel “Maurice” is a heart-racing story of coming to terms with one’s sexuality and identity in the face of disapproval and misunderstanding. Amid the rigid conformity of pre–World War I English society, Maurice Hall (James Wilby) and Clive Durham (Hugh Grant) find themselves falling in love at Cambridge. At a time when homosexuality is punishable by imprisonment, the two must keep their feelings for one another a complete secret. After Clive abandons his forbidden love and marries a woman, Maurice is left alone to struggle with his identity and self-confidence—until a chance encounter brings about a profound change in his life and outlook."
"In this moving short film from 2009, Max Ophuls’s son, Marcel—the award-winning director of the documentary THE SORROW AND THE PITY—pays tribute to his father and discusses his own role as an assistant director on LOLA MONTÉS. Also included are excerpts from contemporary and archival interviews with many of Max Ophuls’s key collaborators."
Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell’s classic theory about the behavior of gas molecules is represented on-screen by a man performing a series of Canadian air force exercises.
"When a rash of strikes and political turmoil bubbles up in 1968 France, Milou (Michel Piccoli) finds himself unable to bury his mother."
"With this compassionate, startling comedy that could have come from no other artistic sensibility, the brilliant Miranda July reveals a world both familiar and strange—an original vision of creativity, sexuality, childhood, and loneliness that emerges from a series of braided vignettes around a pair of potential lovers: Richard, a newly single shoe salesman and father of two (John Hawkes), and Christine, a lonely video artist and “Eldercab” driver (July). While they take hesitant steps toward romance, Richard’s sons follow their own curiosity toward their first sexual experiences, online and in real life, venturing into uncharted territories in their attempts to connect with others. Playful and profoundly transgressive, ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW is a poetic look at the tortuous routes we take to intimacy in an isolating world, and the moments of magic and redemption that unite us."
"A slow-burning depiction of economic degradation in Thatcher’s England, Mike Leigh’s MEANTIME is the culmination of the writer-director’s pioneering work in television. Unemployment is rampant in London’s working-class East End, where a middle-aged couple and their two sons languish in a claustrophobic public-housing flat. As the brothers (Phil Daniels and Tim Roth) grow increasingly disaffected, Leigh punctuates the grinding boredom of their daily existence with tense encounters, including with a priggish aunt (Marion Bailey) who has managed to become middle-class and a blithering skinhead on the verge of psychosis (a scene-stealing Gary Oldman, in his first major role). Informed by Leigh’s now trademark improvisational process and propelled by the lurching rhythms of its Beckett-like dialogue, MEANTIME is an unrelenting, often blisteringly funny look at life on the dole."
"Of the two feature endeavors made around the Games of the XVI Olympiad in 1956, THE MELBOURNE RENDEZ-VOUS, directed by René Lucot, excels. Its tone is more observant and more inquiring than that of most Olympic films. Shooting in Agfacolor, Lucot and his crew focus on the human aspect of the Melbourne Games, in a quirky manner that prefigures Kon Ichikawa's TOKYO OLYMPIAD, to be made eight years later."
"Given that the weather during the Olympic Summer Games in 1952 was miserable, with frequent bouts of rain, this fifty-minute color film is able to capture something more of the enthusiastic mood of the Finnish crowds, by comparison with the black and white of WHERE THE WORLD MEETS and GOLD AND GLORY."
"This film by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea is the most renowned work in the history of Cuban cinema. After his wife and family flee in the wake of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the bourgeois intellectual Sergio (Sergio Corrieri) passes his days wandering Havana in idle reflection, his amorous entanglements and political ambivalence gradually giving way to a mounting sense of alienation. With this adaptation of an innovative novel by Edmundo Desnoes, Gutiérrez Alea developed a cinematic style as radical as the times he was chronicling, creating a collage of vivid impressions through the use of experimental editing techniques, archival material, and spontaneously shot street scenes. Intimate and densely layered, MEMORIES OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT provides an indictment of its protagonist’s disengagement and an extraordinary glimpse of life in postrevolutionary Cuba."
"Allan King brings us in close to the people who reside and work in a home for geriatric care in this beautifully conceived, powerful documentary. For four months, King follows the daily routines of eight patients suffering from dementia and memory loss; the result is searing, compassionate drama that can bring to the viewer a greater understanding of his or her loved ones."
"When the secretary of a theater critic is convinced to rewrite a scathing review of a new production of Othello, she soon becomes enamored of the play's star... much to the chagrin of his wife, who is playing Desdemona!"
"The fourth film from Akira Kurosawa is based on a legendary twelfth-century incident in which the lord Yoshitsune and a group of samurai retainers dressed as monks in order to pass through a dangerous enemy checkpoint. The story was dramatized for centuries in Noh and Kabuki Theater, and here it becomes one of the director's most riveting early films."
"New German Cinema icon Rainer Werner Fassbinder kicked off a new phase of his young career when he made the startling THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS. In this anguished yet mordantly funny film, Fassbinder charts the decline of a self-destructive former policeman and war veteran struggling to make ends meet for his family by working as a fruit vendor. Fassbinder had gained acclaim for a series of trenchant, quickly made early films, but for this one he took more time and forged a new style—featuring a more complexly woven script and narrative structure and more sophisticated use of the camera, and influenced by the work of his recently discovered idol, Douglas Sirk. The result is a meticulously made, unforgiving social satire."
"One of Ebony Film Corporation’s most ambitious comedies is, like most of their surviving work, tragically marred by the decomposition of the nitrate film stock. Fortunately, enough of the storyline shines through that it may still be appreciated as a clever knockabout comedy, and not solely as a crumbling historical relic. The caricatures of the Egyptians in this film and the Chinese laundryman in A RECKLESS ROVER suggest that producer Luther Pollard and his collaborators abided by the belief that turnabout is fair play."
"One of director Dorothy Arzner’s most fascinatingly subversive portraits of marital dysfunction stars Sylvia Sidney as a wealthy socialite who falls in love with an alcoholic writer (Fredric March), kicking off a rollercoaster relationship that will drag them both through the depths of hedonistic abandon. Tackling issues of addiction and open relationships with striking sophistication, MERRILY WE GO TO HELL was Arzner’s personal favorite among her own films. Look out for a young Cary Grant in an early supporting role as one of Sidney’s suitors."
"In this captivating, skewed World War II drama from Nagisa Oshima, David Bowie regally embodies Celliers, a British officer interned by the Japanese as a POW. Rock star Ryuichi Sakamoto (who also composed this film’s hypnotic score) plays the camp commander, obsessed with the mysterious blond major, while Tom Conti is the British lieutenant colonel Lawrence, who tries to bridge the emotional and language divides between captor and prisoner. Also featuring actor-director Takeshi Kitano in his first dramatic role, MERRY CHRISTMAS MR. LAWRENCE is a multilayered, brutal, at times erotic tale of culture clash, and one of Oshima’s greatest successes."
"One of the great American independent films of the 1990s, the surprise hit METROPOLITAN, by writer-director Whit Stillman, is a sparkling comedic chronicle of a young man’s romantic misadventures while trying to fit in to New York City’s debutante society. Stillman’s deft, literate dialogue and hilariously highbrow observations earned this first film an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. Beneath the wit and sophistication, though, lies a tender tale of adolescent anxiety."
An introverted high school student struggles to adjust to her new life in Taipei before meeting an outgoing classmate and a brooding music shop owner.
"Bette Gordon’s first film, made in collaboration with James Benning, is both an investigation of the relationship between two women and a formalist study of cinematic syntax."
"This documentary by Academy Award winner Steven Okazaki explores the accidental movie career of Toshiro Mifune, one of the true giants of world cinema. Mifune made sixteen remarkable films with director Akira Kurosawa during the golden age of Japanese Cinema, including RASHOMON, SEVEN SAMURAI, and YOJIMBO. Together they thrilled audiences and influenced filmmaking around the world, providing direct inspiration for not only THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood’s breakthrough, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, but also George Lucas’s STAR WARS."
"The legendary Gilbert and Sullivan troupe the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company joined forces with Hollywood for this 1939 Technicolor version of the beloved comic opera “The Mikado,” the first work by the famed duo to be adapted for the screen. Directed by musician and Oscar-nominated filmmaker Victor Schertzinger, it is a lavish cinematic retelling of the British political satire set in exotic Japan, with such enduringly popular numbers as “A Wand’ring Minstrel I” and “Three Little Maids from School,” and featuring American singer Kenny Baker as well as a host of renowned D’Oyly Carte performers, including Martyn Green and Sydney Granville."
"Elaine May crafted a gangster film like no other in the nocturnal odyssey MIKEY AND NICKY, capitalizing on the chemistry between frequent collaborators John Cassavetes and Peter Falk by casting them together as small-time mobsters whose lifelong relationship has turned sour. Set over the course of one night, this restless drama finds Nicky (Cassavetes) holed up in a hotel after the boss he stole money from puts a hit out on him. Terrified, he calls on Mikey (Falk), the one person he thinks can save him. Scripted to match the live-wire energy of its stars—alongside supporting players Ned Beatty, Joyce Van Patten, and Carol Grace—and inspired by real-life characters from May’s own childhood, this unbridled portrait of male friendship turned tragic is an unsung masterpiece of American cinema."
Andrea Arnold’s debut short is a searing exploration of grief and coping in which a woman struggles to find meaning following a miscarriage.
"Through forces out of his control, a lowly milkman becomes a middleweight boxing champion."
"Featuring Joan Blondell in a scene-stealing early supporting role, this salacious melodrama follows the tumultuous journey of its title character (Helen Twelvetrees), a small-town girl who marries a New York City businessman with whom she has a daughter, only to see her life upended when she catches her husband with another woman. Years later, a much-hardened Millie has refashioned herself as an independent woman—only to once again become engulfed in a sensational scandal."
"An impoverished artist discovers he has purchased a winning lottery ticket at the very moment his creditors come to collect. The only problem is, the ticket is in the pocket of his coat. . . which he left at his girlfriend’s apartment. . . who gave the coat to a man hiding from the police. . . who sells the coat to an opera singer who uses it during a performance. By turns charming and inventive, René Clair’s lyrical masterpiece had a profound impact on not only the Marx Brothers and Charlie Chaplin, but on the American musical as a whole."
"In the village of Fuentecilla, there is a medicinal spa which was very popular in the past but that now has been forgotten by the public. In order to bring back the tourists, the 'prominent men' of the village organize a fake miracle: the apparition of San Dimas, the local patron saint, which will take place every Thursday night. At first it works, but trouble begins when a stranger appears, claiming that he knows what's going on and making peculiar demands in exchange for his silence."
"A dying middle-aged man reminisces on his own life, in turn reflecting on the past half-century of Russian history. This autobiographical poem from Andrei Tarkovsky is a stunningly sensual odyssey through the halls of memory."
"Iranian master Jafar Panahi explores the interplay of imagination and reality in this slyly inventive meta-film marvel. When her mother is late to pick her up from school, first grader Mina (Mina Mohammad Khani) takes matters into her own hands, navigating the public transportation and bustling traffic of Tehran on a precarious adventure of the everyday. But what begins as a charming child’s-eye portrait of Iranian society soon reveals itself to be something even richer and more surprising, as Panahi turns the conventions of narrative filmmaking inside out."
"Paul Schrader’s visually stunning, collagelike portrait of the acclaimed Japanese author and playwright Yukio Mishima (played by Ken Ogata) investigates the inner turmoil and contradictions of a man who attempted the impossible task of finding harmony among self, art, and society. Taking place on the last day of Mishima’s life, when he famously committed public seppuku, the film is punctuated by extended flashbacks to the writer’s past as well as gloriously stylized evocations of his fictional works. With its rich cinematography by John Bailey, exquisite sets and costumes by Eiko Ishioka, and unforgettable, highly influential score by Philip Glass, MISHIMA: A LIFE IN FOUR CHAPTERS is a tribute to its subject and a bold, investigative work of art in its own right."
"As Shirley Temple grew up before the eyes of America, this delightful comeback vehicle offered her a chance to shine in a new kind of film: a charming teenage romance, complete with jive-talking, jitterbug-mad bobby soxers. She displays her patented pluck (and receives her first on-screen kiss) as starry-eyed fourteen-year-old Annie Rooney, who pines for nerdy classmate Marty (Dickie Moore) even though his wealthy family looks down on her working-class background. When Annie’s father (William Gargan) invents a new form of synthetic rubber, however, it may just be her ticket to love."
"Swedish filmmaker Alf Sjöberg’s visually innovative, Cannes Grand Prix-winning adaptation of August Strindberg’s renowned 1888 play brings to scalding life the excoriating words of the stage’s preeminent surveyor of all things rotten in the state of male-female relations. MISS JULIE vividly depicts the battle of the sexes and classes that ensues when a wealthy businessman’s daughter (Anita Björk, in a fiercely emotional performance) falls for her father’s bitter servant. Celebrated for its unique cinematic style (and censored upon its first release in the United States for its adult content), Sjöberg’s film was an important turning point in Scandinavian cinema."
"They say that if you put your ear to the back of his neck, you can hear the Virgin talk."
"A decade after he broke through with BREAKER MORANT, Australian director Bruce Beresford made another acclaimed film about the effects of colonialism on the individual. In a performance that earned him the Berlin Film Festival’s Silver Bear for best actor, Maynard Eziashi plays the title character, a Nigerian villager eager to work as a civil servant for the British authorities, including a sympathetic district officer (Pierce Brosnan), in the hope that it will benefit him in the future. Instead, his ambition leads to his tragic downfall. MISTER JOHNSON, based on the 1939 novel by Joyce Cary, is a graceful, heartfelt drama about the limits of idealism, affectingly acted and handsomely shot."
"The story takes place in provincial France, where a group of young boys (""mistons"" roughly translates ""brats"") are infatuated with a beautiful young woman. Jealous of her passionate affair, they conspire to make mischief for the woman and her boyfriend."
"For the television program “Ciné parade” in 1982, Claude Chabrol was asked to inaugurate a series of contemporary homages to classic cinema. Chabrol—himself often a director of tense psychosexual dramas—chose the ur-thriller M. In this short, a sort of M in ten minutes, Maurice Risch plays Peter Lorre playing Hans Beckert."
"Assembled from archival footage of Canada’s First Nations peoples and cut to a pulse-quickening electronic soundtrack, MOBILIZE is a breathless journey from the northern woods to the tops of New York skyscrapers, almost all of which have been constructed in part by Mohawk ironworkers."
A tale of magic and mutation half remembered by a teen poet whose beloved has mysteriously disappeared.
"In 1977 France, the Ministry of the Future chooses two 'normal,' white, middle-class citizens, Claudine (Anémone) and Jean-Michel (André Dussolier), for a national experiment. They will be monitored and displayed on television for six months in a model apartment outfitted with state-of-the-art products and nonstop surveillance - the template for 'a new city for the new man.' A searing satire of the breakdown of individual freedoms in the face of increasing governmental invasions of privacy, William Klein's THE MODEL COUPLE deftly investigates the fine line between democracy and totalitarianism."
An examination of the lifestyles of female college students in 1966. Directed by Eric Rohmer.
"Albert Brooks takes an incisive look at the state of modern relationships in this hilarious and cutting anti–romantic comedy. Brilliantly embracing his inner cad, Brooks stars as Robert Cole, a neurotic Hollywood film editor whose rollercoaster romance with remarkably forgiving bank executive Mary Harvard (Kathryn Harrold) is constantly undercut by his doubts about their relationship. When Robert breaks things off in order to explore other options, he risks losing the best thing he’s ever had. In only his second feature, Brooks firmly established his distinctive comedic voice and confirmed his status as one of American cinema’s most astute observers of human nature."
"MODERN TIMES, Charlie Chaplin’s last outing as the Little Tramp, puts the iconic character to work as a giddily inept factory employee who becomes smitten with a gorgeous gamine (Paulette Goddard). With its barrage of unforgettable gags and sly commentary on class struggle during the Great Depression, MODERN TIMES—though made almost a decade into the talkie era and containing moments of sound (even song!)—is a timeless showcase of Chaplin’s untouchable genius as a director of silent comedy."
"THE MOMENT OF TRUTH (IL MOMENTO DELLA VERITÀ), from director Francesco Rosi, is a visceral plunge into the life of a famous torero—played by real-life bullfighting legend Miguel Mateo, known as Miguelín. Charting his rise and fall with a single-minded focus on the bloody business at hand, the film is at once gritty and operatic, placing the viewer right in the thick of the ring’s action, as close to death as possible. Like all of the great Italian truth seeker’s films, this is not just an electrifying drama but also a profound and moving inquiry into a violent world—and it’s perhaps the greatest bullfighting movie ever made."
"Writer-director Neil Jordan’s breakthrough film is a brilliant, noir-infused love story. Bob Hoskins (who snagged an Oscar nomination for his performance) plays George, a small-time loser employed as a chauffeur to an enigmatic, high-class call girl. His fascination with her leads him on a dangerous quest through the sordid underbelly of London, where love is a weakness to be exploited and betrayed. "
"Directed with lean, mean efficiency by Bruce Beresford, this gritty crime thriller centers on an armored-car company that has become the target of repeated heists. As company leadership begins enforcing new measures in order to tighten security, they fail to realize that the biggest threat lies within their own ranks. Though it failed at the box office on its release, MONEY MAKERS has gone on to take its place as an Ozploitation cult classic thanks to its propulsive energy and slam-bang action."
"Inspired by love, a misguided monkey believes he is destined for the moon."
"Slapstick prevails again when Jacques Tati’s eccentric, old-fashioned hero, Monsieur Hulot, is set loose in Villa Arpel, the geometric, oppressively ultramodern home of his brother-in-law, and in the antiseptic plastic hose factory where he gets a job. The second Hulot movie and Tati’s first color film, MON ONCLE is a supremely amusing satire of mechanized living and consumer society that earned the director the Academy Award for best foreign-language film."
"Claude Jutra’s evocative portrait of a boy’s coming of age in wintry 1940s rural Quebec has been consistently cited by critics and scholars as the greatest Canadian film of all time. Delicate, naturalistic, and tinged with a striking mix of nostalgia and menace, MON ONCLE ANTOINE follows Benoit, as he first encounters the twin terrors of sex and death, and his fellow villagers, who are living under the thumb of the local asbestos mine owner. Set during one ominous Christmas, MON ONCLE ANTOINE is a holiday film unlike any other, and an authentically detailed illustration of childhood’s twilight."
"MON ONCLE D’AMÉRIQUE is unique in cinema—one of the oddest movies ever to emerge from the hand of director Alain Resnais, and also perhaps his most popular, steeped in elements of popular culture, social critique, and behavioral psychology, yet accessible enough to have achieved mass popularity, not only in France (where it won six Cesar Awards—their equivalent of the Oscar) but also in America. A trio of people (Gerard Depardieu, Nicole Garcia, Roger Pierre) are presented as “case histories” by a lecturer—and we see them not only in their work environments, but also in terms of the cinematic role models (Jean Gabin, Jean Marais, Danielle Darrieux) that have helped shape their self-images."
"Monsieur Hulot, Jacques Tati’s endearing clown, takes a holiday at a seaside resort, where his presence provokes one catastrophe after another. Tati’s masterpiece of gentle slapstick is a series of effortlessly well-choreographed sight gags involving dogs, boats, and firecrackers; it was the first entry in the Hulot series and the film that launched its maker to international stardom."
"Neglected for decades, this chilling existentialist mystery has reemerged as one of director Joseph Losey’s most virtuosic works. In perhaps the finest performance of his career, Alain Delon stars as the wealthy Robert Klein, an amoral art dealer in Nazi-occupied Paris who exploits the persecution of his Jewish countrymen by buying and selling their paintings. When Klein is mistaken for a Jewish man of the same name, he is plunged into a labyrinthine identity crisis with life-or-death consequences. Through his moody, mesmerizing visual style, Losey weaves a Kafkaesque web of steadily mounting paranoia."
"Charlie Chaplin plays shockingly against type in his most controversial film, a brilliant and bleak black comedy about money, marriage, and murder. Chaplin is a twentieth-century bluebeard, an enigmatic family man who goes to extreme lengths to support his wife and child, attempting to bump off a series of wealthy widows (including one played by the indefatigable Martha Raye, in a hilarious performance). This deeply philosophical and wildly entertaining film is a work of true sophistication, both for the moral questions it dares to ask and for the way it deconstructs its megastar’s lovable on-screen persona."
"On a beautiful June weekend in 1967, at the beginning of the Summer of Love, the Monterey International Pop Festival roared forward, capturing a decade’s spirit and ushering in a new era of rock and roll. Monterey featured career-making performances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Otis Redding, but they were just a few of the performers in a wildly diverse lineup that included Simon and Garfunkel, the Mamas and the Papas, the Who, the Byrds, Hugh Masekela, and the extraordinary Ravi Shankar. With his characteristic vérité style—and a camera crew that included the likes of Albert Maysles and Richard Leacock—D. A. Pennebaker captured it all, immortalizing moments that have become legend: Pete Townshend smashing his guitar, Jimi Hendrix burning his, Mama Cass watching Janis Joplin’s performance in awe. "
"After the 1995 Kobe earthquake, a writer remembers travelling with his family to bury his brother after World War II. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda."
"The first Finnish film was made in 1907, but sadly lost forever. So to mark the 100th anniversary year of the Finnish independence, film has now been remade by Juho Kuosmanen (THE HAPPIEST DAY IN THE LIFE OF OLLI MÄKI) following several silent film traditions: shot on B&W 16 mm film and performed with live music and a live foley artist. In the film two siblings inherit all the essentials for a good life: moonshine equipment and a pig. As they embark on their journey, business is good until a card shark arrives."
A naive student follows a young woman to Ibiza before developing a heroin dependency. Barbet Schroeder's debut film features an unrelenting view of 1960s culture and an original score by Pink Floyd.
"Kinoshita's first film after the end of World War II is a wrenching, superbly wrought tale about a liberal-minded Japanese family torn apart by war and imperialist politics. Morning for the Osone Family is both palpably bitter about the nation's fresh wartime wounds and inspiringly hopeful about a democratic tomorrow."
"This portrait of female volunteer workers at an optics plant during World War II, shot on location at the Nippon Kogaku factory, was created with a patriotic agenda. Yet thanks to Akira Kurosawa's groundbreaking semidocumentary approach, The Most Beautiful is a revealing look at Japanese women of the era and anticipates the aesthetics of Japanese cinema's postwar social realism."
"One of the best and most literate movies from the great days of horror, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME stars Leslie Banks as a big-game hunter with a taste for the world’s most exotic prey, his houseguests, played by Fay Wray and Joel McCrea. Before making history with 1933’s KING KONG, filmmakers Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack wowed audiences with their chilling adaptation of this Richard Connell short story."
"Following his second divorce, a science fiction author (writer-director Albert Brooks) realizes he is never going to find lasting love if he doesn't straighten out his relationship with his mother first. But when he moves back in with his maddeningly passive-aggressive mom (Debbie Reynolds in a smashing comeback performance), it soon becomes clear that she has no intention of making the process easy for him. With his customary blend of sharp observational humor and all-American angst, Albert Brooks delivers an alternately hilarious and painfully relatable look at the complicated ties that bind parents and children."
"Mikio Naruse's 1952 Mother (aka Okaasan) is rather more upbeat (and, at times, even light-hearted) than his better-known later movies. Kinuyo Tanaka (who later became Japanese cinema's first woman director) quietly dominates the screen throughout as the fiercely resourceful mother in postwar Japan, trying to provide a decent life for her four children. The director creates a convincingly realistic evocation of a woman's point-of-view, aided in no small measure by the fine acting all around."
"After her husband kills his boss and himself, Mother Kusters becomes drawn into the activities of the German Communist party and then a group of anarchists."
"Family turmoil ensues when, after his father's death, an eldest son is revealed as a scion of a long-dead first wife. (Presented without score.)"
"Construction on a new housing development disturbs Godzilla faces off against the benevolent insect monster-god Mothra in this clash of the titans, a crossover battle between two of Toho Studios’ most popular monsters—the last in which Godzilla would figure as a malevolent villain rather than a fearsome hero. Mothra vs. Godzilla marks a creative high point in the Godzilla series, with pointed social commentary from director Ishiro Honda, a masterful score by Akira Ifukube, and astonishing special-effects work by Eiji Tsuburaya."
"Robert Bresson plumbs great reservoirs of feeling with MOUCHETTE, one of the most searing portraits of human desperation ever put on film. Faced with a dying mother, an absent, alcoholic father, and a baby brother in need of care, the teenage Mouchette seeks solace in nature and daily routine, a respite from her economic and pubescent turmoil. An essential work of French filmmaking, Bresson’s hugely empathetic drama elevates its trapped protagonist into one of the cinema’s great tragic figures."
"One of cinema’s greatest and most profound meditations on mortality, THE MOUTH AGAPE observes, with striking unsentimentality, the final days of a terminally ill woman (Monique Mélinand) as those around her—her philandering husband (Hubert Deschamps), aloof son (Philippe Léotard), and worried daughter-in-law (Nathalie Baye)—attempt to carry on with their lives as they await the inevitable. Through unflinching long takes, Pialat crafts a masterpiece of human observation that says as much about life as it does about death."
"Harold Lloyd plays a young man who has a profound desire to be in the movies. Unfortunately, he has no real acting experience or abilities."
"William Klein moved into more blatantly political territory with this hilarious, vicious Vietnam-era lampoon of imperialist American foreign policy. Mr. Freedom (John Abbey), a bellowing good-ol'-boy superhero decked out in copious football padding, jets to France to cut off a Commie invasion from Switzerland. A destructive, arrogant patriot in tight pants, Freedom joins forces with Marie Madeleine (a satirically sexy Delphine Seyrig) to combat lefty freethinkers, as well as the insidious evildoers Moujik Man and inflatable Red China Man, culminating in a star-spangled showdown of kitschy excess. Delightfully crass, Mr. Freedom is a trenchant, rib-tickling takedown of gaudy modern Americana."
"Hiroshi Shimizu's endearing road movie follows the long and winding route of a sweet-natured bus driver, nicknamed Mr. Thank You for his constant exclamation to pedestrians who kindly step out of his way, traveling from rural Izu to Tokyo. Romance and comedy occur, and tragedy threatens his passengers, a virtual microcosm of depression-era Japan."
"Matsugoro is a poor rickshaw driver whose animated spirit and optimistic demeanor make him a favorite of the town. Matsu helps an injured boy, Toshio, and is hired by the boy's parents, Kotaro and Yoshioko, to transport the boy to and from doctor appointments. Matsu comes to love the boy and his parents. When Toshio's father dies, Matsu becomes a surrogate father, helping to raise the boy and secretly falling in love with Toshio's mother Yoshioko. But Matsu knows there is a great gulf between their classes and there seems no hope that Matsu can ever be more than the rickshaw man to the mother and son."
"The gloriously grotesque second feature directed by John Waters is replete with all manner of depravity, from robbery to murder to one of cinema’s most memorably blasphemous moments. Made on a shoestring budget in Waters’ native Baltimore, with the filmmaker taking on nearly every technical task, this gleeful mockery of the peace-and-love ethos of its era features the Cavalcade of Perversion, a traveling show mounted by a troupe of misfits whose shocking proclivities are topped only by those of their leader: the glammer-than-glam, larger-than-life Divine, out for blood after discovering her lover’s affair. Starring Waters’ beloved regular cast the Dreamlanders (including David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Mink Stole, Susan Lowe, George Figgs, and Cookie Mueller), MULTIPLE MANIACS is an anarchic masterwork from an artist who has doggedly tested the limits of good taste for decades."
"The following is the first complete student short Roman Polanski made at the State Film School in Lodz, Poland. A story told in almost total darkness and in one room, the film introduces themes the director has revisited throughout his career."
"Alain Resnais's MURIEL, OR THE TIME OF RETURN, the director's follow-up to LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, is as radical a reflection on the nature of time and memory as its predecessor. The always luminous Delphine Seyrig stars as an antique shop owner and widow in Boulogne-sur-Mer, whose past comes back to haunt her when a former lover reenters her life. Meanwhile, her stepson is tormented by his own ghosts, related to his service in France's recently ended war in Algeria. Featuring a multilayered script by Jean Cayrol and inventively edited to evoke its middle-class characters' political and personal realities, the fragmented, emotionally powerful MURIEL reminds viewers that the past is always present."
"Louis Malle’s critically acclaimed MURMUR OF THE HEART gracefully combines elements of comedy, drama, and autobiography in a candid portrait of a precocious adolescent boy’s sexual maturation. Both shocking and deeply poignant, this is one of the finest coming-of-age films ever made."
"After returning to Los Angeles from France in 1979, Agnès Varda created this kaleidoscopic documentary about the striking murals that decorate the city. Bursting with color and vitality, MUR MURS is as much an invigorating study of community and diversity as it is an essential catalog of unusual public art."
"Acclaimed experimental filmmaker Jem Cohen applies his singular vision to narrative in this mesmerizing tale of two adrift strangers who find refuge in Vienna’s grand Kunsthistorisches Art Museum. Johann (Bobby Sommer), a museum guard, spends his days silently observing both the art and the visitors. Anne (Mary Margaret O’Hara), suddenly called to Vienna from overseas, has been wandering the city in a state of limbo. A chance meeting sparks a deepening connection that draws them through the halls of the museum and the streets of the city. The exquisitely photographed MUSEUM HOURS is an ode to the bonds of friendship, an exploration of an unseen Vienna, and the power of art to both mirror and alter our lives."
"Presented here is THE MUSICIANS, by Kazimierz Karabasz. Karabasz was a teacher at the Lodz Film School, where director Krzysztof Kieślowski studied, and a great influence on the young filmmaker."
"With THE MUSIC ROOM (JALSAGHAR), Satyajit Ray brilliantly evokes the crumbling opulence of the world of a fallen aristocrat (the beloved actor Chhabi Biswas) desperately clinging to a fading way of life. His greatest joy is the music room in which he has hosted lavish concerts over the years—now a shadow of its former vivid self. An incandescent depiction of the clash between tradition and modernity, and a showcase for some of India’s most popular musicians of the day, THE MUSIC ROOM is a defining work by the great Bengali filmmaker."
"Deniz Gamze Ergüven’s stunning debut feature is an exhilarating immersion into the world of a spirited Turkish girl and her four teenage sisters, who are placed under virtual lockdown and threatened with the prospect of arranged marriages after they are accused of indecency by their conservative family. Rebelling against their oppressive home life, the girls find strength in one another as they begin to plot their escape. Unfolding with raw, heart-pounding immediacy, MUSTANG is both a stinging indictment of patriarchal misogyny and a joyous celebration of sisterly bonds."
"Marooned by design in a strange asteroid inhabited by bizarre creatures, a left-for-dead astronaut miraculously heads back to Earth with a band of abominable mutant aliens to tie up some loose ends, after twenty long years in oblivion. Indie animation wizard Bill Plympton launches his uniquely unhinged imagination into outer space for this hilariously irreverent, gleefully gonzo send up of cheesy science-fiction B movies."
"For her award-winning breakthrough film, director Gillian Armstrong drew on teenage author Miles Franklin’s novel, a celebrated turn-of-the-twentieth-century Australian coming-of-age story, to brashly upend the conventions of period romance. Headstrong young Sybylla Melvyn (Judy Davis, in a star-making performance), bemoans her stifling life in the backcountry, where her writerly ambitions receive little encouragement, and craves independence above all else. When a handsome landowner (Sam Neill), disarmed by her unruly charms, begins to court her, Sybylla must decide whether she can reconcile the prospect of marriage with the illustrious life’s work she has imagined for herself. Suffused with generous humor and a youthful appetite for experience, MY BRILLIANT CAREER is a luminous portrait of an ardently free spirit."
"Recut and restored twenty-five years after its ill-fated premiere, Charles Burnett’s second feature is an eye-opening revelation—wise, funny, heartbreaking, and timeless. Pierce Mundy works at his parents’ South Central dry cleaners with no prospects for the future and his childhood buddies in prison or dead. With his best friend just getting out of jail and his brother busy planning a wedding to a snooty upper-middle-class black woman, Pierce navigates his conflicting obligations while trying to figure out what he really wants in life."
"Jean-Pierre Gorin's gripping and unique film about a Samoan street gang in Long Beach, California, is, like other works by the filmmaker, a probing look at a closed community with its own rules, rituals, and language. Part observational documentary, part fiction invisibly scripted and shaped by the director, My Crasy Life, which won a special jury prize at Sundance, is an enthralling and intensely focused contemplation of violence and dislocation."
"In this captivating and philosophical film directed by Louis Malle, actor and playwright Wallace Shawn sits down with his friend the theater director André Gregory at a restaurant on New York’s Upper West Side, and the pair proceed through an alternately whimsical and despairing confessional about love, death, money, and all the superstition in between. Playing variations on their own New York–honed personas, Shawn and Gregory, who also cowrote the screenplay, dive in with introspective intellectual gusto, and Malle captures it all with a delicate, artful detachment. A fascinating freeze-frame of cosmopolitan culture, MY DINNER WITH ANDRÉ remains a unique work in cinema history."
Four homeless orphans struggle to survive in Rio de Janiero's slums.
"Few people know that Napoleon Bonaparte had two wives. He married Marie Louise for an heir, but he married Josephine, his first wife, for love. Aadid works in the laundromat with Adela. Adela is a woman who is very good. She's simple. She's not complicated. She's not someone who makes up schemes. She's very gracious. Lovely. She is Aidid's Josephine."
"MY LIFE AS A DOG (MITT LIV SOM HUND) tells the story of Ingemar, a twelve-year-old from a working-class family sent to live with his uncle in a country village when his mother falls ill. There, with the help of the warmhearted eccentrics who populate the town, the boy finds both refuge from his misfortunes and unexpected adventure. Featuring an incredibly mature and unaffected performance by the young Anton Glanzelius, this film is a beloved and bittersweet evocation of the struggles and joys of childhood from Oscar-nominated director Lasse Hallström."
"Hong Kong martial-arts greats Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, and Yuen Biao join forces in this goofball kung fu lark, the second film in Hung’s popular LUCKY STARS series. Chan is an undercover cop who enlists his bumbling former orphanage pals, the five Lucky Stars, to help him track down a corrupt cop hiding out in the Japanese underworld. From the dazzling amusement-park-set opening—with Chan scaling a Ferris wheel in one of his most jaw-dropping stunts—to the thrilling haunted-house finale, MY LUCKY STARS offers its trio of legends a true chance to shine."
The fatal fall to Earth of heroic World War II pilot Andrew Mynarski is rendered with white-hot expressionist intensity in this stroboscopic collage of live action and animation.
"In MY NIGHT AT MAUD’s, the brilliantly accomplished centerpiece of the Six Moral Tales series, Jean-Louis Trintignant plays Jean-Louis, one of the great conflicted figures of 1960s cinema. A Catholic engineer in his early thirties, he lives by a strict moral code and immerses himself in mathematics and the philosophy of Blaise Pascal. After spotting the delicate Françoise at Mass, he vows to make her his wife, although when he spends an unplanned night at the apartment of the bold divorcée Maud, his rigid standards are challenged."
"Apichatpong Weerasethakul brought an appetite for experimentation to Thai cinema with his debut feature, an uncategorizable work that refracts documentary impressions of his homeland through the surrealist concept of the exquisite corpse game. Enlisting locals to contribute improvised narration to a simple tale, Apichatpong charts the collective construction of the fiction as each new encounter imbues it with unpredictable shades of fantasy and pathos. Shot over the course of two years in 16 mm black and white, MYSTERIOUS OBJECT AT NOON established the director’s fascination with the porous boundaries between the real and the imagined."
"Two young men are haunted by an event from their past in this powerful drama from Gregg Araki. Ten years earlier, in the summer of 1981, Brian (Brady Corbet) blacked out for five hours, only to wake up in his basement with a bloody nose and no memory of what happened. Now eighteen, he has become obsessed with the possibility that he was abducted by aliens. When he reconnects with Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his former Little League teammate who is now a gay hustler living in New York, Brian discovers the key to unlocking the truth about what happened that day. Fearlessly tacking an explosive subject, Araki crafts a profoundly sensitive, dreamily poetic exploration of childhood trauma and its repercussions."
"Aloof teenage Japanese tourists, a frazzled Italian widow, and a disgruntled British immigrant all converge in the city of dreams—which, in MYSTERY TRAIN, from Jim Jarmusch, is Memphis. Made with its director’s customary precision and wit, this triptych of stories pays playful tribute to the home of Stax Records, Sun Studio, Graceland, Carl Perkins, and, of course, the King, who presides over the film like a spirit. MYSTERY TRAIN is one of Jarmusch’s very best movies, a boozy and beautiful pilgrimage to an iconic American ghost town and a paean to the music it gave the world."
"Hungarian trailblazer Ildikó Enyedi’s award-winning first feature is a luminous, unconventional fairy tale. Two twins, Lili the anarchist and Dóra, a luxurious woman of loose morals (both played by Dorota Segda), are separated as young girls. Their lives proceed on opposing tracks until their paths reconnect on the Orient Express with Mr. Z (Tarkovsky mainstay Oleg Yankovsky), who loves them jointly. Defiantly in pursuit of happiness and in retreat from the “mass murdering century,” they are all entranced by Thomas Edison’s inventions and drunk on the miracle of existence. Among the greatest of cinematic debuts, MY TWENTIETH CENTURY introduced the world to Enyedi (ON BODY AND SOUL), who remains a vital, distinctive artist into the twenty-first century."
"The geographical dead center of North America and the beloved birthplace of Guy Maddin, Winnipeg is the frosty and mysterious star of Maddin’s “docu-fantasia.” A work of memory and imagination, the film burrows into what the director calls “the heart of the heart” of the continent, conjuring a city as delightful as it is fearsome, populated by sleepwalkers and hockey aficionados. Take part in Winnipeg’s epic annual scavenger hunt! Pay your respects to the racehorses forever frozen in the river! Help judge the yearly Golden Boy pageant! What is real and what is fantasy is left up to the viewer to sort out in Maddin’s hypnotic, expertly conceived paean to that wonderful and terrifying place known as My Hometown."
When the Marquis of Leguineche is forced to sell his palace things spiral from bad to worse as the French Socialist Party is elected to power.
A university student wanders around Paris in this short film by Eric Rohmer.
"In his documentary, NAGANO '98 OLYMPICS: STORIES OF HONOR AND GLORY, Bud Greenspan and his crew lay considerable emphasis, as always, on talking with the competitors. Greenspan's method does lead to some repetition, but there is something so engaging about the filmmaker's passion for sports that makes all his documentaries compelling. One feels that his ideals match those of the Olympic Games. He likes winners but also gallant losers. He unearths excellent archival footage, which gives depth and background to an athlete's current performance."
"The brilliant and controversial NAKED, from director Mike Leigh, stars David Thewlis as Johnny, a charming and eloquent but relentlessly vicious drifter. Rejecting anyone who might care for him, the volcanic Johnny hurls himself around London on a nocturnal odyssey, colliding with a succession of other desperate and dispossessed people and scorching everyone in his path. With a virtuoso script and raw performances from Thewlis and costars Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp, Leigh’s depiction of England’s underbelly is an amalgam of black comedy and doomsday prophecy that took the best director and best actor prizes at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival."
"“There are eight million stories in the Naked City,” as the narrator immortally states at the close of this breathtakingly vivid film and this is one of them. Master noir craftsman Jules Dassin and newspaperman-cum-producer Mark Hellinger’s dazzling police procedural, THE NAKED CITY, was shot entirely on location in New York. As influenced by Italian neorealism as American crime fiction, this double Academy Award winner remains a benchmark for naturalism in noir, living and breathing in the promises and perils of the Big Apple, from its lowest depths to its highest skyscrapers"
"Director Kaneto Shindo's documentary-like, dialogue-free portrayal of daily struggle is a work of stunning visual beauty and invention. The international breakthrough for one of Japan's most innovative filmmakers, who went on to make other unique masterworks such as ONIBABA and KURONEKO, THE NAKED ISLAND follows a family whose home is on a tiny, remote island in the Japanese archipelago. They must row a great distance to another shore, collect water from a well in buckets, and row back to their island, a nearly backbreaking task essential for the survival of these people and their land. Featuring a phenomenal modernist score by Hikaru Hayashi, this is a truly hypnotic experience, with a rhythm unlike that of any other film."
"The setup is pure pulp: A former prostitute (a crackerjack Constance Towers) relocates to a buttoned-down suburb, determined to fit in with mainstream society. But in the strange, hallucinatory territory of writer-director-producer Samuel Fuller, perverse secrets simmer beneath the wholesome surface. Featuring radical visual touches, full-throttle performances, brilliant cinematography by Stanley Cortez, and one bizarrely beautiful musical number, THE NAKED KISS is among Fuller’s greatest, boldest entertainments."
"James Stewart sheds his nice-guy image with his dark, complex turn in this intense psychological western, the third of his five celebrated forays into the genre under the direction of Anthony Mann. Howard Kemp (Stewart) lost his ranch and his faithless wife while he was fighting in the Civil War. Now, to earn a new stake, Kemp and two greedy strangers go after the bounty on Ben Vandergroat (Robert Ryan), who is wanted for the murder of a marshal. Along the way, they meet Lina Patch (Janet Leigh), Vandergroat’s girlfriend and the only voice of reason and compassion among the five people locked in a violent pursuit across the unforgiving terrain of the Colorado Rockies."
"Robert Flaherty’s classic film tells the story of Inuit hunter Nanook and his family as they struggle to survive in the harsh conditions of Canada’s Hudson Bay region. Enormously popular when released in 1922, NANOOK OF THE NORTH is a cinematic milestone that continues to enchant audiences. Criterion is proud to present the original director’s cut, restored to the proper frame rate and tinted according to Flaherty’s personal print."
"In No Blood Relation, a gripping early example of Mikio Naruse's cinematic boldness, featuring a screenplay by Ozu's famed collaborator Kogo Noda, an actress returns to Tokyo after a successful stint in Hollywood to reclaim, with the help of her gangster brother, the daughter she abandoned years before."
"Erik Skjoldbjærg was the first Norwegian to attend the National Film and Television School in London, where he graduated in 1994. While there, he directed a number of short films, including NEAR WINTER."
"Lilly plans to get her ears pierced, until her parents’ incessant quarreling begins to cause problems. This skillful look at shifting family dynamics insightfully explores the stages children go through when processing change. Anahita Ghazvinizadeh’s subtle approach leads to a powerful payoff. The short film was the winner of the Cinéfondation award at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival."
"Under a tight deadline, a playwright moves to a rural neighborhood to avoid the distractions of the city, but he discovers there are plenty of ways to get sidetracked in his new home, too."
"In this Oscar-winning short film, Norman McLaren employs the principles normally used to put drawings or puppets into motion to animate live actors. The story is a parable about two people who come to blows over the possession of a flower."
"This short film by Miranda July is composed of four alternating stories that deal with control, sexuality, and childhood—themes she would develop more fully in ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW."
"In six chapters, the “stinging moments” that mark the lives of various women are evoked with striking, poetic intimacy."
"With the polio epidemic striking terror in the hearts of millions—in 1949, it caused more than 2,700 deaths in the U.S. alone—Ida Lupino made this semiautobiographical melodrama about a dancer-choreographer (Sally Forrest) who struggles to overcome the disease that has crippled her body and her confidence. The film’s unusually hard-eyed realism was born of Lupino’s own dark memories of polio as an aspiring teenage actress, as well as her use of documentary locations and nonprofessional actors—most tenderly in the famous wheelchair square dance filmed (by veteran John Ford cinematographer Archie Stout) with actual rehab patients at the Kabat-Kaiser Institute in Santa Monica."
"Harold Lloyd plays a young man who is in love with a young woman, but he mistakenly believes she loves another. Despondent, he decides to commit suicide, but each attempt is unsuccessful."
"Letters from Chantal Akerman's mother are read over a series of elegantly composed shots of 1976 New York, where our (unseen) filmmaker and protagonist has relocated. Akerman's unforgettable time capsule of the city is also a gorgeous meditation on urban alienation and personal and familial disconnection."
"This sweeping look at Australian social change traces nearly a decade of upheaval from the late forties through the midfifties, as experienced by two daredevil newsreel cameramen and brothers (Bill Hunter and Gerard Kennedy) who see their profession threatened by the rise of television and the demand for increasingly sensational stories. Seamlessly interweaving archival newsreel footage of key historical events into its narrative, NEWSFRONT is a fascinating inside look at the business of creating headlines and a timely, still relevant exploration of the value of truth and integrity in reporting."
"During an opulent and luxurious banquet, complete with cavalier servers and valets, eleven pampered guests participate in what appears to be a ritualistic gastronomic carnage. In this absurd and grotesque universe, an unexpected sequence of events undermines the endless symphony of abundance."
"Atom Egoyan’s striking debut finds the director already working through the themes of technology, isolation, and identity that recur obsessively throughout his work. Peter (Patrick Tierney) is catatonically unhappy with his family life and in video therapy with his parents. One day he views the tapes of an Armenian family who guiltily put their infant son up for adoption years ago. Peter decides to present himself to them as their lost son in a quest to act out a role different than the one assigned to him in his own miserable existence."
"Filmed at Pickfair, the home of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, in 1922, as a wedding present for Lord and Lady Mountbatten, this short features Charlie Chaplin, Jackie Coogan, and the newlyweds. It is presented with a contemporary score by composer Timothy Brock."
"Ten years after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, filmmaker Alain Resnais documented the abandoned grounds of Auschwitz and Majdanek in NIGHT AND FOG (NUIT ET BROUILLARD), one of the first cinematic reflections on the Holocaust. Juxtaposing the stillness of the abandoned camps’ empty buildings with haunting wartime footage, Resnais investigates humanity’s capacity for violence, and presents the devastating suggestion that such horrors could occur again."
"Nagisa Oshima (b. 1932) released three movies in 1960, all steeped in topical subject matter of special relevance to young viewers, and each came to be regarded as something of a classic NIGHT AND FOG IN JAPAN was both the most critically acclaimed and personally bitter of the three, a brutally honest look at the failure of Japan's activist reform movement. Toshiro Ushido's script was filled with piercing anger and disillusionment, which the director channeled in laser-like precision through his camera."
"In a time when adultery is punishable by death, a man who feels he has driven his wife to be unfaithful must save her from being executed. Directed by Tadashi Imai."
"Ursula leaves the convent where she was educated, to start living with her uncle, the count Ribera, and her aunt Florentine. When she arrives, she is confronted with a local drama: a youngman from the village, Lambert, whose sister took her own life, accuses the count of being responsible for his sister's death, for having sexually assaulted her. The two men have a duel of honour, in which Lambert is severely wounded, and the count's honour is saved. Ursula acts as a nurse to Lambert, and falls in love with him, only to find out that Lambert is secretly her aunt's lover. One night, the count too, finds out his wife's affair, and again the two men fight, this time Lambert kills the count. Ursula helps him to escape. Florence, mad with jealousy and hatred for her niece, sets the police after him."
"This 1915 short, the twelfth film Charlie Chaplin directed for the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, is based on the play “Mumming Birds,” which Chaplin performed first in London, from 1908 to 1909, and later the United States. In it, Chaplin plays Mr. Pest and Mr. Rowdy. The film is accompanied by a 2014 score by composer Timothy Brock."
A powerfully physical rendering of the Oedipus myth choreographed by Martha Graham.
"This short Guy Maddin film tells the story of inventor Nihad Ademi, who harnesses the power of the aurora borealis in Winnipeg in 1939. Ademi uses this power to broadcast images of Canada to its own citizens from coast to coast, but in the process angers he the government."
"Lora Hart (Barbara Stanwyck) is an ambitious student nurse whose first assignment after graduation is tending to a couple of ill little girls. Despite their posh surroundings, the girls are apparently suffering from malnutrition; their mother, Mrs. Ritchey, is a heavy drinker; and the girls’ physician is a society quack. Lora soon realizes that the doctor is deliberately starving the children to death in order to gain access to their trust fund, and that Mrs. Ritchey is kept in line by Nick (Clark Gable), a black-clad gangster posing as the family chauffeur."
"Shot outside Pittsburgh on a shoestring budget, by a band of filmmakers determined to make their mark, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, directed by horror master George A. Romero, is a great story of independent cinema: a midnight hit turned box-office smash that became one of the most influential films of all time. A deceptively simple tale of a group of strangers trapped in a farmhouse who find themselves fending off a horde of recently dead, flesh-eating ghouls, Romero’s claustrophobic vision of a late-1960s America literally tearing itself apart rewrote the rules of the horror genre, combined gruesome gore with acute social commentary, and quietly broke ground by casting a black actor (Duane Jones) in its lead role. Stark, haunting, and more relevant than ever, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is back."
"Five cities. Five taxicabs. A multitude of strangers in the night. Jim Jarmusch assembled an extraordinary international cast of actors (including Gena Rowlands, Winona Ryder, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Béatrice Dalle, and Roberto Benigni) for this quintet of transitory tales of urban displacement and existential angst, all staged as encounters between cabbies and their fares. Spanning time zones, continents, and languages, NIGHT ON EARTH winds its course through scenes of uproarious comedy, nocturnal poetry, and somber fatalism, set to a moody soundtrack by Tom Waits. Jarmusch’s lovingly askew view of humanity from the passenger seat makes for one of his most charming and beloved films, a freewheeling showcase for the cosmopolitan range of his imagination."
"In this unsettling drama from Italian filmmaker Liliana Cavani, a concentration camp survivor (Charlotte Rampling) discovers her former torturer and lover (Dirk Bogarde) working as a porter at a hotel in postwar Vienna. When the couple attempt to re-create their sadomasochistic relationship, his former SS comrades begin to stalk them. Operatic and disturbing, THE NIGHT PORTER deftly examines the lasting social and psychological effects of the Nazi regime."
"On April 14, 1912, just before midnight, the “unsinkable” Titanic struck an iceberg. In less than three hours, it had plunged to the bottom of the sea, taking with it more than 1,500 of its 2,200 passengers. In his unforgettable rendering of Walter Lord’s book of the same name, the acclaimed British director Roy Ward Baker depicts with sensitivity, awe, and a fine sense of tragedy the ship’s last hours. Featuring remarkably restrained performances, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is cinema’s subtlest and best dramatization of this monumental twentieth-century catastrophe."
"Dmitriy Gusev, a nuclear physicist, receives a dangerously high dose of radiation as a result of an accident in which his professor, Sintsov, is fatally exposed. Warned that another exposure would prove fatal, Dmitriy nevertheless refuses a safer job and continues the experimentation. Lyolya, Dmitriy's girl friend, feels that their relationship means little to him and decides to marry their best friend, theoretician Ilya Kulikov. Learning that Dmitriy's life is in danger, however, she realizes that she loves him, and they marry despite his misgivings. From the outset of the marriage, Dmitriy's singular devotion to his work keeps them apart. At a Siberian research center, Dmitriy works together with Ilya, and though Ilya's cynical manner is so different from his own, their disagreements do nothing to mar their friendship and mutual respect. As a new success is obtained, Dmitriy is again exposed to radiation. He persuades Ilya to keep the accident a secret until the experiments are completed. Lyolya, misunderstanding Dmitriy's remoteness, feels that she has failed as a wife. Dmitriy's health deteriorates, and, aware of his doom, he makes a visit to his family. At a Moscow clinic he asks doctors to perform an experimental bone marrow transplant with little chance of success. Ilya comes to visit him on the day before the operation and tells him that their experiments produced a new type of radiation which was not thermonuclear, as anticipated, but nonetheless would be an important contribution to science. As Ilya and Lyolya await the outcome of the operation at the hospital, they receive a note from Dmitriy promising a celebration."
"Nobody's Children is the first half of an overflowing diptych of melodramas chronicling the labyrinthine misfortunes of a couple torn cruelly apart by fate (and meddling villains). When Guido (Amedeo Nazzari), a young count, falls for Luisa (Yvonne Sanson), the poor daughter of one of the miners who works at his family's quarry, his mother and her nefarious henchman scheme epically to separate the two forever."
"This audacious teenage terrorism thriller from acclaimed director Bertrand Bonello recalls Robert Bresson’s THE DEVIL, PROBABLY as much as it does George A. Romero’s DAWN OF THE DEAD. We first follow a group of tense, shifty adolescents as they prowl the streets and subways of Paris, learning through a series of mesmerizingly choreographed set pieces that they’re already well underway with a bombing plot. And then the film becomes something altogether different as these subversives tuck away inside a shopping mall and lose themselves in a consumerist wonderland of clothes, television, toys, and brilliantly deployed pop songs. Will they survive the unseen, encroaching authorities? And, as the walls close in, will they even survive each other?"
"Antek is a young lawyer who dies four days before the beginning of the film, but continues to haunt his beautiful young widow."
"The final film from groundbreaking auteur Chantal Akerman is a deeply personal, heart-woundingly intimate portrait of her relationship with her mother, Natalia, a Holocaust survivor and familiar presence in many of her daughter’s films. Filmed in the months leading up to Natalia’s death, NO HOME MOVIE achieves a shattering emotional resonance as it meditates on loss and mortality while offering profound insight into Akerman’s inner world."
"Downey takes his camera and microphone onto the streets (and into some bedrooms) for a look at Manhattan’s singles scene of the late sixties. Of course, that’s not all: NO MORE EXCUSES cuts between this footage and the fragmented tale of a time-traveling Civil War soldier, a rant from the director of the fictional Society for Indecency to Naked Animals, and other assorted improprieties."
"Over the course of these two stop-motion films, made by Karen Yasinsky in 1999, a woman—with the help of a pair of ruby-red slippers—delves into her fantasies and confronts good and evil before returning safely to the reality of her life."
"In Akira Kurosawa's first film after the end of World War II, future beloved Ozu regular Setsuko Hara gives an astonishing performance as Yukie, the only female protagonist in Kurosawa's body of work and one of his strongest heroes. Transforming herself from genteel bourgeois daughter to independent social activist, Yukie traverses a tumultuous decade in Japanese history."
"With his raw style of filmmaking, Maurice Pialat has been called the John Cassavetes of French cinema, and the scorching À NOS AMOURS is one of his greatest achievements. In a revelatory film debut, the dynamic, fresh-faced Sandrine Bonnaire plays Suzanne, a fifteen-year-old Parisian who embarks on a sexual rampage in an effort to separate herself from her overbearing, beloved father (played with astonishing magnetism by Pialat himself), ineffectual mother, and brutish brother. A tender character study that can erupt in startling violence, À NOS AMOURS is one of the high-water marks of eighties French cinema."
This film is narrated by artist Michael Snow.
"Master documentarian Patricio Guzmán travels ten thousand feet above sea level to the driest place on earth: Chile’s Atacama Desert, where astronomers from all over the world gather to observe the stars in a sky so translucent that it allows them to see to the boundaries of the universe. The Atacama is also a place where the harsh heat of the sun keeps human remains intact, including those of political prisoners “disappeared” by the Chilean army after the 1973 military coup. Just as astronomers search for distant galaxies, surviving relatives of the disappeared search for the remains of their loved ones in a quest to reclaim their families’ histories. Melding the celestial and the earthly, NOSTALGIA FOR THE LIGHT is a gorgeous, moving, and deeply personal odyssey into both Chilean history and the furthest reaches of space."
"This psychologically acute, visually striking modernist work was director Michelangelo Antonioni’s follow-up to the epochal L’AVVENTURA. Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau star as a novelist and his frustrated wife, who, over the course of one night, confront their alienation from each other and the achingly empty bourgeois Milan circles in which they travel. Antonioni’s muse Monica Vitti smolders as an industrialist’s tempting daughter. Moodily sensual cinematography and subtly expressive performances make LA NOTTE an indelible illustration of romantic and social deterioration."
"Marcello Mastroianni, as a lonely city transplant, and Maria Schell, as a sheltered girl haunted by a lover’s promise, meet by chance on a canal bridge and begin a tentative romance that quickly entangles them in a web of longing and self-delusion. Luchino Visconti’s LE NOTTI BIANCHE, an exquisite adaptation of Dostoyevsky’s “White Nights,” translates this romantic, shattering tale of two restless souls into a ravishing black-and-white dream."
"One of the all-time comedy classics, René Clair’s À NOUS LA LIBERTÉ tells the story of Louis, an escaped convict who becomes a wealthy industrialist. Unfortunately, his past returns (in the form of old jail pal Emile) to upset his carefully laid plans. Featuring lighthearted wit, tremendous visual innovation, and masterful manipulation of sound, À NOUS LA LIBERTÉ is both a potent indictment of mechanized modern society and an uproarious comic delight."
"This 1948 film by Antonioni documents the lives of street cleaners in Rome. N.U. is short for Nettezza urbana, the Italian municipal cleaning service."
"It should come as no surprise to anyone watching Le Nuit de Varennes that its maker, Ettore Scola, studied law before turning to filmmaking, and became an expert at socially conscious satire and parody. In this instance, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, fleeing the French Revolution in 1791, confront and debate various historical political and philosophical figures (including Thomas Paine, played by Harvey Keitel!!!) about the nature and causes of the turmoil around them."
"A young, heartbroken man goes to the amusement park, only to see the girl he lost with a new man."
A Scotland Yard man investigates a London psychiatrist's diabolical revenge against his adulterous wife's lover.
"From 1927 to 1928, Jean Painlevé made his first three films aimed at the general public. Shown in ‘ciné-clubs’ and avant-garde movie theaters of Paris, these films were written and edited to entertain as well as educate. THE OCTOPUS, one of these educational films, is presented here in its original silent version. (Presented without score.)"
"Taking place largely over the course of one tense night, Carol Reed’s psychological noir, set in an unnamed Belfast, stars James Mason as a revolutionary ex-con leading a robbery that goes horribly wrong. Injured and hunted by the police, he seeks refuge throughout the city, while the woman he loves (Kathleen Ryan) searches for him among the shadows. Reed and cinematographer Robert Krasker (who would collaborate again on THE THIRD MAN) create images of stunning depth for this fierce, spiritual depiction of a man’s ultimate confrontation with himself."
"Kon Ichikawa’s ODD OBSESSION is a strange dark comedy on a then-forbidden subject—impotence, and jealousy as a cure for it. The movie explores the links between love, jealousy, and rage, all from the standpoint of Kenji Kenmochi (Ganjiro Nakamura), the middle-aged husband of the younger Ikuko (Machiko Kyo), who finds her youth intimidating to the point of sexual paralysis. His solution involves introducing his daughter’s lover to Ikuko."
"The aftereffects of Argentina's Dirty War-during which tens of thousands of civilians were murdered under the military dictatorship-hit close to home for the wife of a government official as she gradually confronts the ways in which her own family is entangled in its legacy. Featuring a masterful performance from Argentine cinema icon Norma Aleandro, who received the best actress prize at Cannes, this Oscar-winning political thriller is a harrowing exploration of how the ghosts of history haunt the present."
"George and Lennie are California migrant workers on the run from the law because of something the simple-minded giant Lennie did. They find work at a local ranch, where they dream of making enough money to buy their own farm with Candy, a long-time ranch hand with savings. Their dreams are threatened by the rancher’s bullying son and his alluring wife, who may very well force George to make the hardest decision of his life in order to spare Lennie."
"Having previously collaborated on their Oscar-winning adaptation of THE TIN DRUM, screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière and director Volker Schlöndorff turned once again to the traumas of mid-twentieth-century Europe in this profoundly unsettling take on Michel Tournier’s novel “The Erl-King.” In an astonishing performance, John Malkovich stars as Abel Tiffauges, a gentle Frenchman whose childlike naivete is twisted by the Nazis toward the most horrible of ends: recruiting young boys for the Hitler Youth. Like THE TIN DRUM, THE OGRE views the horrors of World War II through the expressionistic eyes of a singular, unforgettable character."
A man whose son has been murdered pushes to create laws to financially protect victims' families. Keisuke Kinoshita directs.
A young man's frequent patronage of a prostitute leads to debt.
"A drama teacher casts a woman in a play about torture and the two eventually become lovers. As production of the play develops, the director begins to receive threatening letters."
"Focusing on the trials and determination of one woman (Marfa Lapkina) rather than a large group of people, Sergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov switch their social realist montage to the plight of the individuals power to effect change in Soviet Russia. (Presented without score.)"
"Two old friends reunite for a quietly revelatory overnight camping trip in this breakout feature from Kelly Reichardt, a microbudget study of character and masculinity that introduced many viewers to one of contemporary American cinema’s most independent artists. As expectant father Mark (Daniel London) and nomadic Kurt (Will Oldham) travel by car and foot into the woods in search of some secluded hot springs, their fumbling attempts to reconnect keep butting up against the limits of their friendship and the reality of how much their paths have diverged since their shared youth. Adapted from a short story by Jonathan Raymond and accompanied by an atmospheric Yo La Tengo score, OLD JOY is a contemplative, wryly observed triumph whose modest scale belies the richness of its insight."
For more then 20 years Charles Manson has refused to communicate to the outside world. Until now. These are actual never before heard phone conversations between Canadian best selling author Marlin Marynick and Charles Manson.
"Expressionistic noir photography suffuses David Lean’s OLIVER TWIST with a nightmarish quality, fitting its bleak, industrial setting. In Dickens’ classic tale, an orphan wends his way from cruel apprenticeship to den of thieves in search of a true home. Here Alec Guinness is the quintessential Fagin, his controversial performance fully restored in Criterion’s digital transfer."
"Neglected for nearly seventy years, a singular landmark of lesbian cinema by one of France’s trailblazing women directors reemerges. Plunging the viewer—and the main character—into a lion’s den, Jacqueline Audry depicts a nineteenth-century boarding school for young girls, a house divided between its rival mistresses, Miss Julie (Edwige Feuillère) and Miss Cara (Simone Simon). As the two women compete for the affections of their students, they rouse passion, hatred, and unexpected reversals of fortune. Awash in spellbinding gothic atmosphere and a hothouse air of unspoken desire, OLIVIA is a daring feminist statement decades ahead of its time."
"More has been written about Leni Riefenstahl's OLYMPIA than about any other sports documentary in history. Starting with a long and lyrical overture, evoking the origins of the Olympic Games in ancient Greece, Riefenstahl covers twenty-one athletic events in FESTIVAL OF THE NATIONS, culminating with the marathon. Despite the film's fascist origins, OLYMPIA has achieved a certain respectability and endures as a monument of cinema, and of a malevolent ideology."
"OLYMPIC GAMES, 1956, directed by the documentarist Peter Whitchurch, was commissioned by the Organizing Committee for these Olympic Games. Historically, the film points to some encouraging situations in international affairs, with Hungary taking part in the Games in the immediate wake of the ill-fated uprising in Budapest, and East and West Germany sending a combined team."
"Though shorter than the Italian film covering the same 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, the intimacy on display in this Dutch film is more rewarding and less perfunctory."
"A short tribute to the origins of the Olympic Games shot in 1924. This film is a brief series of tableaux, with athletes posing against a dark stage background and performing the ritual movements of the traditional sports and events."
"THE OLYMPIC GAMES HELD AT CHAMONIX IN 1924 chronicles the first full-scale Olympic Winter Games. In the film, the atmosphere is down to earth and relaxed, communicating the exuberance of winter sports."
"THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN PARIS, 1924 provides exhaustive and engrossing coverage of all the main sports on view. The exploits of Johnny Weissmuller (USA) and Paavo Nurmi (Finland) in Paris turned them into international sports heroes, and the coverage of the tennis tournament includes footage of such legendary players as Jean Borotra (France), René Lacoste (France), and Helen Wills (USA)."
"OLYMPIC GLORY, produced by the experienced Hollywood enterprise the Kennedy/Marshall Company and directed by seasoned documentarist Kieth Merrill, was made in large format for release on the IMAX. The crisp photography and engrossing sound combine with the energetic score to present events like the bobsleigh races in spectacular, thrilling fashion."
"Mexican former Olympic swimmer Alberto Isaac's record of the Mexico City Olympic Games is a celebration not of national achievement (very few national anthems are heard during the film), but of individual heroism. This thoughtful and comprehensive film bristles with offbeat moments, such as underwater shots of the violence and cheating during the water polo matches. The film also yields iconic images, like Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos, on the winners' podium for the 200 meters, their heads bowed, raising clenched, black-gloved fists to the sky in a dramatic gesture of black power and, as Smith has said, of frustration."
"For their short film on the XIII Olympic Winter Games Lake Placid 1980, directors Drummond Challis and Tony Maylam assumed the challenge of making a documentary without any offscreen commentary, relying on music to sustain the flow of images."
"Six years out of prison, Eddie Pedak (Alain Delon) has kept his nose clean, avoiding any contact with his brother (Jack Palance), the head of a criminal gang. Determined to live a normal life, he’s got steady work, a loving wife (Ann-Margret), and a charming young daughter. Unfortunately, Eddie also has enemies, among them a vengeful police inspector (Van Heflin) whose harassment costs the ex-convict his job. In need of money to support his family, Eddie has no choice but to risk his future on one final heist in this hard-edged tale of a desperate man trying to outrun fate. Tautly directed by Ralph Nelson, ONCE A THIEF was written by crime specialist Zekial Marko."
"In this twenty-three-minute slapstick film, directed by Charles Barrois and written by Jacques Tati and René Clément, a shy, out-of-work actor (Tati) unwittingly enters a professional wrestling match. On demande une brute also stars Enrico Sprocani, a famous circus clown known as Rhum."
"An encounter between two of the most remarkable women artists of the twentieth century, ONE DAY PINA ASKED . . . is Chantal Akerman’s look at the world and work of choreographer Pina Bausch and her dance company. Capturing their rehearsals and performances over a five-week European tour, Akerman takes us inside the dancers’ process, exploring the intense emotional and physical journey that they embark on in a quest to illuminate the human condition through movement."
"A celebration of cinema’s centennial, ONE HUNDRED AND ONE NIGHTS finds Agnès Varda at her most playful. It is also perhaps her unlikeliest project: a star-studded comic fantasy with an extravagant sense of style and an adoring but slightly off-kilter perspective on the magic of filmmaking. French New Wave icon Michel Piccoli is a mysterious aging impresario named Simon Cinéma who has hired a young film student, Camille (Julie Gayet), to simply sit with him at his mansion and talk about movies. Skeptical yet increasingly enchanted, Camille bears witness to cinema itself coming to life, allowing Varda to wittily integrate a mind-boggling parade of appearances by screen legends (Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anouk Aimée, Robert De Niro, and many others), and attest to the vigorous health of the movies at the close of the twentieth century."
"For the XVI Olympic Winter Games Albertville 1992, sports documentarists Joe Jay Jalbert and R. Douglas Copsey were assigned to make the official chronicle. The resulting film, ONE LIGHT, ONE WORLD compensates for its rough-and-ready imagery with a zestful approach not just to the Games but to the French Alps, replete with medieval villages."
One man’s day in suburbia goes from bad to worse to the absolute pits.
"In the early 1960s in Paris, two young women become friends. Pomme is an aspiring singer. Suzanne is a pregnant country girl unable to support a third child. Pomme lends Suzanne the money for an illegal abortion, but a sudden tragedy soon separates them. Ten years later, they reunite at a demonstration and pledge to keep in touch via postcard, as each of their lives is irrevocably changed by the women’s liberation movement. A buoyant hymn to sisterly solidarity rooted in the hard-won victories of a generation of women, ONE SINGS, THE OTHER DOESN’T is one of Agnès Varda’s warmest and most politically trenchant films, a feminist musical for the ages."
Masahiro Shinoda's debut film portrays the romantic lives of a group of young night club entertainers.
"Yuzo and his fiancée Masako spend their Sunday afternoon together, trying to have a good time on just thirty-five yen. They manage to have many small adventures, especially because Masako's optimism and belief in dreams is able to lift Yuzo from his realistic despair."
"Deep within the wind-swept marshes of war-torn medieval Japan, an impoverished mother and her daughter-in-law eke out a lonely, desperate existence. Forced to murder lost samurai and sell their belongings for grain, they dump the corpses down a deep, dark hole and live off their meager spoils. When a bedraggled neighbor returns from the skirmishes, lust, jealousy, and rage threaten to destroy the trio’s tenuous existence, before an ominous, ill-gotten demon mask seals the trio’s horrifying fate. Driven by primal emotions, dark eroticism, a frenzied score by Hikaru Hayashi, and stunning images both lyrical and macabre, Kaneto Shindo’s chilling folktale ONIBABA is a singular cinematic experience."
"Electrified by crackling dialogue and visual craftsmanship of the great Howard Hawks, ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS stars Jean Arthur as a traveling entertainer who gets more than she bargained for during a stopover in a South American port town. There she meets a handsome and aloof daredevil pilot, played by Cary Grant, who runs an airmail company, staring down death while servicing towns in treacherous mountain terrain. Both attracted to and repelled by his romantic sense of danger, she decides to stay on, despite his protestations. This masterful and mysterious adventure, featuring Oscar-nominated special effects, high-wire aerial photography, and Rita Hayworth in a small but breakout role, explores Hawks’s recurring themes of masculine codes and the strong-willed women who question them."
Guy Maddin directed this short as part of an installation at the Winnipeg Art Gallery for its centennial in 2012.
"When Valdemar Moreaux a carousel operator in a travelling fun-fair owned by his girl friend, learns that he is the bastard son of an aristocrat, he moves into his father's manor to be made over into aristocrat himself. It is he the hope of Colonel von Brede, the father, that Valdemar will be made worthy of carrying on the von Brede name and inherit his property. Von Brede is also the guardian of the beautiful and highly intelligent Eva Beckman (Ingrid Bergman). His other hope is that Valdemar and Eva will fall in love and get married. The initial coolness between this young couple gradually disappears and they agree to marry. But all hopes are dashed when Eva is confronted with the physical side of love, which she finds disgusting. Valdemar then realizes that he cannot be made over into another person and he returns to the fair and the honest simplicity of his former girl friend, Helga Mårtensson."
"Yasujiro Ozu’s first talkie, the uncommonly poignant THE ONLY SON is among the Japanese director’s greatest works. In its simple story about a good-natured mother who gives up everything to ensure her son’s education and future, Ozu touches on universal themes of sacrifice, family, love, and disappointment. Spanning many years, THE ONLY SON is a family portrait in miniature, shot and edited with its maker’s customary exquisite control."
"Based on a comic one-act play by Georges Feydeau, the hour-long ON PURGE BÉBÉ is Jean Renoir’s first sound film. It was made in 1931, the same year as LA CHIENNE."
A young man of Korean descent living in China dreams of leaving his remote village and starting a new life in South Korea—but first he must track down his elusive father.
"Before TINY FURNITURE, director Lena Dunham made a number of short films, one of which is presented here."
"Pregnant with her first child, director Agnès Varda turned her camera to her immediate surroundings capturing day-to-day life along the Rue Mouffetard. Lacking synch sound and incorporating a number of unconventional techniques, this short work displays Varda’s freestyle approach to filmmaking and its subject matter."
"An artist uses a spell to free herself from an abusive relationship in this experimental revenge tale told through rap, song, Cantonese, Shakespearean verse, sign language, and Jamaican patois."
"A farmer’s family is torn apart by faith, sanctity, and love—one child believes he’s Jesus Christ, a second proclaims himself agnostic, and the third falls in love with a fundamentalist’s daughter. Putting the lie to the term “organized religion,” ORDET (THE WORD) is a challenge to simple facts and dogmatic orthodoxy. Layering multiple stories of faith and rebellion, Dreyer’s adaptation of Kaj Munk’s play quietly builds towards a shattering, miraculous climax."
"In turn-of-the-twentieth-century Turin, an accident in a textile factory incites workers to stage a walkout. But it’s not until they receive unexpected aid from a traveling professor (Marcello Mastroianni) that they find their voice, unite, and stand up for themselves. This historical drama by Mario Monicelli, brimming with humor and honesty, is a beautiful and moving ode to the power of the people, and features engaging, naturalistic performances; cinematography by the great Giuseppe Rotunno; and a multilayered, Oscar-nominated screenplay by Monicelli, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli."
"This legendary, long-unavailable documentary from Direct Cinema pioneer D. A. Pennebaker captures the behind-the-scenes drama that went into the making of a classic Broadway recording. When Stephen Sondheim’s groundbreaking concept musical “Company” opened on Broadway in 1970, it was an immediate triumph. Shortly thereafter, the actors, musicians, and Sondheim assembled to record the original cast album in a grueling, nearly nineteen-hour session that tested the talents of all involved—including Elaine Stritch, who pushed herself to the limit to record what would become her iconic version of “The Ladies Who Lunch.” With raw immediacy, Pennebaker and his crew document the explosive energy and creative intensity that go into capturing the lightning-in-a-bottle magic of live performance."
"Two bruised souls enact a tender, hesitant romance in Hiroshi Shimizu's alternately poignant and playful wartime love story. A soldier (Chishu Ryu) is forced to prolong his stay at a rural spa when he accidentally cuts his foot on the titular object. Soon enough he tracks down its lovely owner (Kinuyo Tanaka) and finds himself smitten."
"This freewheeling documentary captures Ornette Coleman’s evolution over three decades. Documentary footage, dramatic scenes, and some of the first music-video-style segments ever made chronicle his boyhood in segregated Texas and his subsequent emergence as an American cultural pioneer and world-class composer and performer. Among those who contribute to the film are William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Buckminster Fuller, Don Cherry, Yoko Ono, Charlie Haden, Robert Palmer, Jayne Cortez, and John Rockwell."
"Jean Cocteau’s update of the Orpheus myth depicts a famous poet (Jean Marais), scorned by the Left Bank youth, and his love for both his wife, Eurydice (Marie Déa), and a mysterious princess (Maria Casarès). Seeking inspiration, the poet follows the princess from the world of the living to the land of the dead, through Cocteau’s famous mirrored portal. ORPHEUS’s peerless visual poetry and dreamlike storytelling represent the legendary Cocteau at the height of his powers."
"Made early in Agnès Varda’s career, this lushly shot Eastmancolor short was commissioned by the national tourism board to promote the medieval castles of the Loire Valley region. It deviates from the standard travelogue format by making room for witty asides, lyrical montage, and the filmmaker’s abiding interest in everyday working-class people."
"A critical and popular triumph, Osaka Elegy established Mizoguchi as one of Japan's major filmmakers. The director's often-used leading actress Isuzu Yamada stars as Ayako, a switchboard operator trapped in a compromising, ruinous relationship with her boss to help support her wastrel father. With its fluid cinematography and deft storytelling, Osaka Elegy ushered in a new era of sound melodrama for Mizoguchi."
"O SPORT, YOU ARE PEACE! is the official film of the Games of the XXII Olympiad Moscow 1980, Games that were dogged by a boycott on the part of the United States because of the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan. Undeterred, Moscow devoted enormous effort to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, setting the bar high for future host cities, and director Yuri Ozerov records them in loving detail."
"The first film in Pedro Costa's transformative trilogy about Fontainhas, an impoverished quarter of Lisbon, OSSOS is a tale of young lives torn apart by desperation. After a suicidal teenage girl gives birth, she misguidedly entrusts her baby's safety to the troubled, deadbeat father, whose violent actions take the viewer on a tour of the foreboding, crumbling shantytown in which they live. With its reserved, shadowy cinematography by Emmanuel Machuel (who collaborated with Bresson on L'argent), OSSOS is a haunting look at a devastated community."
"This wry, melancholic comedy from Aki Kaurismäki, a response to the ongoing global refugee crisis, follows two people searching for a place to call home. Khaled (Sherwan Haji), a displaced Syrian, lands in Helsinki as a stowaway; meanwhile, middle-aged Finnish salesman Wikström (Sakari Kuosmanen) leaves his wife and his job and buys a conspicuously unprofitable restaurant. Khaled is denied asylum but decides not to return to Aleppo, and the paths of the two men cross fortuitously. As deadpan as the best of the director's work, and with a deep well of empathy for its down-but-not-out characters (many of them played by members of Kaurismäki's loyal stock company), THE OTHER SIDE OF HOPE is a bittersweet celebration of pockets of human kindness in an unwelcoming world."
"When two sisters fall in love with the same man, one must decide to look elsewhere. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda."
"A mysterious stranger comes to work at Halla's farm and the two fall in love. When it is exposed the the stranger is Eyvind, a known thief forced into his life of crime by his families starvation, the two go on the run. (Presented without score.)"
"Seamlessly interweaving archival war footage with a fictional narrative, this immersive account of one twenty-year-old’s journey from basic training to the front lines of D-day brings to life all the terrors and isolation of war with jolting authenticity. OVERLORD, directed by Stuart Cooper and impressionistically shot by Stanley Kubrick’s longtime cinematographer John Alcott, is both a document of World War II and a dreamlike meditation on human smallness in a large, incomprehensible machine."
A young woman (Merle Oberon) who has just come into an enormous fortune finds her career-driven fiance unwilling to join her in living the good life.
"Ten years ago, the Screech was the hottest lesbian band around. But the mighty musicians have fallen into relative obscurity and unanticipated turmoil. Iris (Guinevere Turner) dreams of a comeback and drinks too much. MJ (V. S. Brodie) is her ex, but neither of them can quite let go. Former bandmate Lily (Lisa Gornick) and her partner, Carol (Cheryl Dunye), aren’t getting along—so, naturally, they’re trying to have a child together. A pool party goes horribly wrong, and a shocking event knocks these longtime friends and lovers even further off their axes. Generations collide with dangerous results for these Older, Wiser Lesbians, or OWLs."
"Roberto Rossellini’s follow-up to his breakout ROME OPEN CITY was the ambitious, enormously moving PAISAN, which consists of six episodes set during the liberation of Italy at the end of World War II, and taking place across the country, from Sicily to the northern Po valley. With its documentary-like visuals and intermingled cast of actors and nonprofessionals, Italians and their American liberators, this look at the struggles of different cultures to communicate and of people to live their everyday lives in extreme circumstances is equal parts charming sentiment and vivid reality. A long-missing treasure of Italian cinema, PAISAN is available here in its full original release version."
"In this cool, seductive jewel of the Japanese New Wave, a yakuza, fresh out of prison, becomes entangled with a beautiful and enigmatic gambling addict; what at first seems a redemptive relationship ends up leading him further down the criminal path. Bewitchingly shot and edited, and laced with a fever-dream-like score by Toru Takemitsu, this gangster romance was a breakthrough for the idiosyncratic Masahiro Shinoda. The pitch-black PALE FLOWER (KAWAITA HANA) is an unforgettable excursion into the underworld."
"A photographer moves to Palermo in order to escape from his past. There, he meets a young woman and attempts to adhere to his new way of life."
"One of the masters of early German cinema, G. W. Pabst had an innate talent for discovering actresses (including Greta Garbo). And perhaps none of his female stars shone brighter than Kansas native and onetime Ziegfeld girl Louise Brooks, whose legendary persona was defined by Pabst’s lurid, controversial melodrama PANDORA’S BOX. Sensationally modern, the film follows the downward spiral of the fiery, brash, yet innocent showgirl Lulu, whose sexual vivacity has a devastating effect on everyone she comes in contact with. Daring and stylish, PANDORA’S BOX is one of silent cinema’s great masterworks and a testament to Brooks’s dazzling individuality."
"For his final film, Jacques Tati takes his camera to the circus, where the director himself serves as master of ceremonies. Though it features many spectacles, including clowns, jugglers, acrobats, contortionists, and more, PARADE also focuses on the spectators, making this stripped-down work a testament to the communion between audience and entertainment. Created for Swedish television (with Ingmar Bergman’s legendary director of photography Gunnar Fischer serving as one of its cinematographers), PARADE is a touching career send-off that recalls its maker’s origins as a mime and theater performer."
Three immigrant window cleaners risk their lives every day rappelling down some of Chicago's tallest sky-scrapers. PARAISO reveals the danger of their job and what they see on the way down.
"One of the original critics turned filmmakers who helped jump-start the French New Wave, Jacques Rivette began shooting his debut feature in 1958, well before that cinema revolution officially kicked off with THE 400 BLOWS and BREATHLESS. Ultimately released in 1961, the rich and mysterious PARIS BELONGS TO US offers some of the radical flavor that would define the movement, with a particularly Rivettian twist. The film follows a young literature student (Betty Schneider) who befriends the members of a loose-knit group of twentysomethings in Paris, united by the apparent suicide of an acquaintance. Suffused with a lingering post-World War II disillusionment while also evincing the playfulness and fascination with theatrical performance and conspiracy that would become hallmarks for the director, PARIS BELONGS TO US marked the provocative start to a brilliant directorial career."
"New German Cinema pioneer Wim Wenders (WINGS OF DESIRE) brings his keen eye for landscape to the American Southwest in PARIS, TEXAS, a profoundly moving character study written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Sam Shepard. PARIS, TEXAS follows the mysterious, nearly mute drifter Travis (a magnificent Harry Dean Stanton, whose face is a landscape all its own) as he tries to reconnect with his young son, living with his brother (Dean Stockwell) in Los Angeles, and his missing wife (Nastassja Kinski). From this simple setup, Wenders and Shepard produce a powerful statement on codes of masculinity and the myth of the American family, as well as an exquisite visual exploration of a vast, crumbling world of canyons and neon."
"Groundbreaking in its sensitive, nuanced depiction of gay relationships in the midst of New York’s AIDS crisis, this tender and witty drama revolves around two men, Michael (Richard Ganoung) and Robert (John Bolger), who have been lovers for years. Robert is being transferred out of the country for two years, leaving Michael behind. Their close friend Nick (Steve Buscemi in one of his earliest roles), who is also Michael’s former lover, is dying of AIDS. Amid these upheavals, each man must navigate the loyalties of friendship and the vicissitudes of romantic love."
"The first of many films featuring the endearing single-dad Kihachi (played wonderfully by Takeshi Sakamoto), PASSING FANCY is a humorous and heartfelt study of a close, if fraught, father-son relationship. With an ever more sophisticated visual style and understanding of fragile human relationships, Ozu seamlessly weaves rib-tickling comedy and weighty family drama for this distinguished precursor to a brilliant career."
David Lean's THE PASSIONATE FRIENDS tells the story of a married woman (Ann Todd) who struggles to end an affair with the man she loves.
This short film co-directed by Jane Campion and Gerard Lee portrays the awkward trials of everyday living.
"When Andreas (Max von Sydow) meets Anna (Liv Ullmann) he is a man struggling with the collapse of both his marriage and his emotional state. Subsequently, Anna is grieving the recent loss of her husband and son, and the two enter into a relationship. As things continue to deteriorate around them so do both of their mental states."
"Spiritual rapture and institutional hypocrisy come to stark, vivid life in one of the most transcendent masterpieces of the silent era. Chronicling the trial of Joan of Arc in the hours leading up to her execution, Danish master Carl Theodor Dreyer depicts her torment with startling immediacy, employing an array of techniques—expressionistic lighting, interconnected sets, painfully intimate close-ups—to immerse viewers in her subjective experience. Anchoring Dreyer’s audacious formal experimentation is a legendary performance by Renée Falconetti, whose haunted face channels both the agony and the ecstasy of martyrdom."
"With the release in 1955 of Satyajit Ray’s debut, PATHER PANCHALI, an eloquent and important new cinematic voice made itself heard all over the world. A depiction of rural Bengali life in a style inspired by Italian neorealism, this naturalistic but poetic evocation of a number of years in the life of a family introduces us to both little Apu and, just as essentially, the women who will help shape him: his independent older sister, Durga; his harried mother, Sarbajaya, who, with her husband away, must hold the family together; and his kindly and mischievous elderly “auntie,” Indir—vivid, multifaceted characters all. With resplendent photography informed by its young protagonist’s perpetual sense of discovery, PATHER PANCHALI, which won an award for Best Human Document at Cannes, is an immersive cinematic experience and a film of elemental power."
"Around the year 1000 AD, warlike people, the so-called Tjuder, roam in northern Scandinavia. As they brutally kill a family in a remote area, including the parents and their little daughter, the families teenage son, Aigin, observes the slaughter. He manages to flee from these killers and reaches a camp with other Sámi. Afraid of the murderous people, they decide to flee to the coast while the boy stays alone to avenge his family’s murder. Unfortunately, the killers capture him and force him to lead them to the other Sámi. He guides them but has a plan to destroy the barbarous people before reaching the camp."
"After the death of Franco's regime, the Marquis of Leguineche returns to Madrid only to find that many things have changed since his departure."
A desperately lonely woman (Gaby Hoffmann) tries—and fails spectacularly—to make friends.
"Saul J. Turell's Academy Award-winning documentary short Paul Robeson: Tribute to an Artist, narrated by Sidney Poitier, traces his career through his activism and his socially charged performances of his signature song, ""Ol' Man River."""
"Chaplin plays a productive bricklayer who lives by the adage, ""Work hard, play hard."" With a stack of money burning a hole in his pocket, he bickers with his wife on the best way to allocate the payday funds."
"Sacha Guitry plays four roles--including François I and Napoleon III--in this multilingual whirlwind of pageantry investigating the history of seven pearls, four of which end up on the crown of England and three of which go missing. The Pearls of the Crown rockets through four centuries of European history with imaginative, winking irreverence."
"A manifesto of sorts for the Czech New Wave, this five-part anthology shows off the breadth of expression offered by the movement's versatile directors."
"This documentary of the VIII Olympic Winter Games Squaw Valley 1960, directed by Austrian sports journalist and sometime screen actor Heribert Meisel, is the first known visual record of an edition of the Winter Games in the United States. A West German-U.S. coproduction, PEOPLE, HOPES, MEDALS accentuates the novel and romantic aspects of these Games."
"Years before they became major players in Hollywood, a group of young German filmmakers, including eventual noir masters Robert Siodmak and Edgar G. Ulmer and future Oscar winners Billy Wilder and Fred Zinnemann, worked together on the once-in-a-lifetime collaboration PEOPLE ON SUNDAY (MENSCHEN AM SONNTAG). This effervescent, sunlit silent, about a handful of city dwellers (a charming cast of nonprofessionals) enjoying a weekend outing, offers a rare glimpse of Weimar-era Berlin. A unique hybrid of documentary and fictional storytelling, PEOPLE ON SUNDAY was both an experiment and a mainstream hit that would influence generations of film artists around the world."
"The notorious Pépé le moko (Jean Gabin, in a truly iconic performance) is a wanted man: women long for him, rivals hope to destroy him, and the law is breathing down his neck at every turn. On the lam in the labyrinthine Casbah of Algiers, Pépé is safe from the clutches of the police—until a Parisian playgirl compels him to risk his life and leave its confines once and for all. One of the most influential films of the 20th century and a landmark of French poetic realism, Julien Duvivier’s PÉPÉ LE MOKO is presented here in its full-length version."
"Carlos Saura's PEPPERMINT FRAPPE was made in the mid-1960s, when Franco's fascist regime was still ruling Spain, and the movie is very much an allegory about its own era -- a rigidly conservative middle-aged man finds himself hopelessly enamored of his best friend's wife, and runs up against the boundaries that his beliefs place on his behavior. Saura dedicated the film to Luis Buñuel, the renowned director who had been twice exiled from Spain."
"In the vein of such classic coming-of-age films as Francois Truffaut’s THE 400 BLOWS, Diane Kurys’s PEPPERMINT SODA captures a defining moment in the tumultuous life and development of young people. Anne (Eléonore Klarwein) and Frédérique (Odile Michel) are sisters entering their teen years in 1963 France, torn between divorced parents and struggling with the confines of their strict school. Along the way, they undergo an awakening both political and romantic. Kurys’s celebrated debut feature revels in the comedy and tragedy of the seemingly mundane, weaving a complex tapestry of everyday existence that also touches on the universal."
"In recent years, director Toshio Masuda has worked on the international stage with action-oriented movies such as Tora! Tora! Tora! and the Space Cruiser Yamato films. But he began his career in the middle-late 1950s with The Perfect Game (aka Kanzen Na Yuugi), a shockingly amoral tale of delinquency, rape, and murder that was to Japan, what In Cold Blood was to American cinema. It was among the earliest works in the career of a director who has generated little except major box office hits in Japan since the 1950s."
Young Hipster Aloyisius Christopher Parker wanders an eerily vacant Manhattan in Jim Jarmusch's first feature.
"By the midsixties, Ingmar Bergman had already conjured many of the cinema’s most unforgettable images. But with the radical PERSONA, he attained new levels of visual poetry. In the first of a series of legendary performances for Bergman, Liv Ullmann plays a stage actor who has inexplicably gone mute; an equally mesmerizing Bibi Andersson is the garrulous young nurse caring for her in a remote island cottage. While isolated together there, the women undergo a mysterious spiritual and emotional transference. Performed with astonishing nuance and shot in stark contrast and soft light by Sven Nykvist, the influential PERSONA is a penetrating, dreamlike work of profound psychological depth."
"Before his convention-shattering debut, BREATHLESS, had even premiered, Jean-Luc Godard leapt into the making of his second feature, a thriller that would tackle the most controversial subject in France: the use of torture in the Algerian War. Despite his lack of political convictions, photojournalist Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor) is roped into a paramilitary group waging a shadow war in Geneva against the Algerian independence movement. Anna Karina (in her first collaboration with Godard, whose camera is visibly besotted with her) is beguiling as the mysterious woman with whom Forestier becomes infatuated. Banned for two and a half years by French censors for its depiction of brutal tactics on the part of the French government and the Algerian fighters alike, LE PETIT SOLDAT finds the young Godard already retooling cinema as a vehicle for existential inquiry, political argument, and ephemeral portraiture—in other words, as a medium for delivering “truth twenty-four times per second.”"
"The Petrified Forest, based on a best-selling novel by Shintaro Ishihara, follows a young med student's relationships with two women: a dangerous affair with a childhood friend and his mother's struggle to rebuild their estranged relationship. Masahiro Shinoda's film provides a look at 1970s Japan seen through the eyes of the great director."
"The last person to die on New Year’s Eve before the clock strikes twelve is doomed to take the reins of Death’s chariot and work tirelessly collecting fresh souls for the next year. So says the legend that drives THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE (KÖRKARLEN), directed by the father of Swedish cinema, Victor Sjöström. The story, based on a novel by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf, concerns an alcoholic, abusive ne’er-do-well (Sjöström himself) who is shown the error of his ways, and the pure-of-heart Salvation Army sister who believes in his redemption. This extraordinarily rich and innovative silent classic (which inspired Ingmar Bergman to make movies) is a Dickensian ghost story and a deeply moving morality tale, as well as a showcase for groundbreaking special effects."
"Following the tragic death of his father, a young boy's family trains his horse to compete in the local derby."
"The first of the celebrated noirs made by genre master Robert Siodmak puts an intriguing, protofeminist spin on the hard-boiled detective genre. Based on a novel by pulp existentialist Cornell Woolrich, PHANTOM LADY stars Ella Raines as a secretary who descends into the seedy underbelly of the New York City night world in order to track down a mysterious woman, the only witness who she believes can help clear her boss of a murder rap. Elisha Cook Jr.’s frenzied, sexually charged drum solo is one of the indelible highlights of this descent into dreamlike dread."
"A look inside one of the world’s most extraordinary museum collections: Sir Henry Wellcome’s unique trove of medical curiosities. With their customary dexterity and affinity for the arcane, the Quay Brothers imaginatively document this unique assemblage and bring it hauntingly to life."
"Bourgeois convention is demolished in Luis Buñuel’s surrealist gem THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY. Featuring an elegant soiree with guests seated at toilet bowls, poker-playing monks using religious medals as chips, and police officers looking for a missing girl who is right under their noses, this perverse, playfully absurd comedy of non sequiturs deftly compiles many of the themes that preoccupied Buñuel throughout his career—from the hypocrisy of conventional morality to the arbitrariness of social arrangements."
"What could possibly be inside that gigantic, wrapped-and-ribboned box? A tollbooth, a toy car, and adventure! Ride with young Milo (Butch Patrick) through the phantom tollbooth that takes him from the streets of San Francisco into a wondrous world that combines the enchantment of Norton Juster’s beloved children’s book with the sheer visual joy of legendary LOONEY TUNES animator Chuck Jones (codirecting his sole feature film). Bookended by live-action sequences and featuring a stellar voice cast led by the great Mel Blanc, THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH brings to life a magical, musical tale of warring kingdoms (one favors words, the other numbers), demons, princesses, and fabulously fantastical creatures—including a tick-tick-ticking “watch” dog!"
"This evocative and haunting drama, set in rubble-strewn Berlin in 1945, is like no other film about post-World War II Jewish-German identity. After surviving Auschwitz, a former cabaret singer (Nina Hoss, in a dazzling, multilayered performance) has her disfigured face reconstructed and returns to her war-ravaged hometown to seek out her gentile husband, who may or may not have betrayed her to the Nazis. Without recognizing her, he enlists her to play his wife in a bizarre hall-of-shattered-mirrors story that is as richly metaphorical as it is preposterously engrossing. Revenge film or tale of romantic reconciliation? One doesn't know until the superb closing scene of this marvel from Christian Petzold, one of the most important figures in contemporary German cinema."
A young war widow remembers her short time with her husband. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"PHYSICAL PINBALL was made by director David Gordon Green in 1998, while he was a student at the North Carolina School of the Arts. The film features Candace Evanofski and Eddie Rouse, two of the actors in GEORGE WASHINGTON."
"In this riveting study of the dynamics of control, Academy Award–winning director Michael Haneke takes on Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek’s controversial 1983 novel about perverse female sexuality and the world of classical music. Haneke finds his match in Isabelle Huppert, who delivers an icy but quietly seething performance as Erika, a piano professor at a Viennese conservatory who lives with her mother in a claustrophobically codepen­dent relation­ship. Severely repressed, she satisfies her mas­ochistic urges only voyeuristically until she meets Walter (Benoît Magimel), a student whose desire for Erika leads to a destructive infatuation that upsets the careful equilibrium of her life. A critical breakthrough for Haneke, THE PIANO TEACHER—which won the Grand Prix as well as dual acting awards for its stars at Cannes—is a formalist masterwork that remains a shocking sensation."
"Let us reflect on the brief existence of Pickle the fish. Although he could not swim, he was lovingly cared for by a couple that kept him propped up in a sponge. Along with an obese chicken, a cat with a heart condition, and a paraplegic possum, his life is a celebration of man's eternal capacity to care for all creatures. He will be dearly missed."
"This incomparable story of crime and redemption from the French master Robert Bresson follows Michel, a young pickpocket who spends his days working the streets, subway cars, and train stations of Paris. As his compulsive pursuit of the thrill of stealing grows, however, so does his fear that his luck is about to run out. A cornerstone of the career of this most economical and profoundly spiritual of filmmakers, PICKPOCKET is an elegantly crafted, tautly choreographed study of humanity in all its mischief and grace, the work of a director at the height of his powers."
"This sensual and striking chronicle of a disappearance and its aftermath put director Peter Weir on the map and helped usher in a new era of Australian cinema. Based on an acclaimed 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK is set at the turn of the twentieth century and concerns a small group of students from an all-female college who vanish, along with a chaperone, while on a St. Valentine’s Day outing. Less a mystery than a journey into the mystic, as well as an inquiry into issues of class and sexual repression in Australian society, Weir’s gorgeous, disquieting film is a work of poetic horror whose secrets haunt viewers to this day."
An enthusiastic man sits on a park bench and explains the behaviors and rituals of pigeons.
"A dazzling, unruly portrait of postwar Japan, PIGS AND BATTLESHIPS details, with escalating absurdity, the desperate power struggles between small-time gangsters in the port town of Yokosuka. Shot in gorgeously composed, bustling CinemaScope, the film follows a young couple as they try to navigate Yokosuka’s corrupt businessmen, chimpira, and their own unsure future together. With its breakneck pacing and constantly inventive cinematography, this film marked Shohei Imamura as a major voice in Japanese cinema."
"A prison escapee trades his state issued attire for that of a pastor, not realizing the holy calling that comes with the garb. The pilgrimage takes him to a Texas border town where he seeks redemption while on the run."
"One Sunday at church, twelve-year-old Amber experiences her first kiss, a moment of innocence that triggers a series of awakenings: sexual, emotional, and religious."
"The boundless imagination and physical marvels of the work of the German modern-dance pioneer Pina Bausch leap off the screen in this exuberant tribute by Wim Wenders. A long-planned film collaboration between the director and the choreographer was in preproduction when Bausch died in 2009. Two years later, Wenders decided to go ahead with the project, reconceiving it as an homage to his late friend. The result, shot in stunning 3D, is a remarkable visual experience and a vivid representation of Bausch’s art, enacted by a group of staggeringly talented dancers from her company, the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch. PINA is an adventurous work of cinema that highlights the bold legacy of one of the world’s true creative visionaries."
"“PINBALL is an experimental animated film of moving abstract paintings which I painted and animated during the past year with a digital camera. The film visualizes my interpretation of George Antheil’s 1952 revision of ‘Ballet Mecanique’ using trigger-fast cutting, painted imagery, and sound effects. It might be described as ‘visual music’ . . . my aim was to make an artwork which is original, fast, and intense. Let loose from narrative confines, I was exploring the nature of time, rhythm, and the abstraction of image and sound.” —Suzan Pitt"
A father tells his son the most epic bedtime story ever.
"When a miner leaves his employers and treks out with his young son to become a migrant worker, he finds himself moving from one eerie landscape to another, intermittently followed (and photographed) by an enigmatic man in a clean, white suit, and eventually coming face-to-face with his inescapable destiny. Hiroshi Teshigahara’s debut feature and first collaboration with novelist Kobo Abe, PITFALL is many things: a mysterious, unsettling ghost story, a portrait of human alienation, and a compellingly surreal critique of soulless industry, shot in elegant black and white."
"With its bracing blend of unflinching realism and aching humanity, Héctor Babenco’s electrifying look at lost youth fighting to survive on the bottom rung of Brazilian society helped put the country’s cinema on the international map. Shot with documentary-like immediacy on the streets of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, PIXOTE follows the eponymous preteen runaway (the heartbreaking Fernando Ramos da Silva, whose own too-short life tragically mirrored that of his character) as he escapes a nightmarish juvenile detention center only to descend into a life of increasingly violent crime alongside a makeshift family of fellow outcasts. Balancing its shocking brutality with moments of tenderness, this stunning journey through Brazil’s underworld is an unforgettable cry from the lower depths that has influenced multiple generations of filmmakers, including Spike Lee, Harmony Korine, and the Safdie brothers."
"Louis Malle presents his entertaining snapshot of the comings and goings on one street corner in Paris. This, Vive le Tour, and Humain, trop humain, Malle's three French-set documentaries, reveal, in an eclectic array of ways, the director's eternal fascination with, and respect for, the everyday lives of everyday people."
"In a small Spanish town, a group of old ladies decide to celebrate Christmas Eve with a 'Sit a poor man at your table' dinner: each wealthy household of the town will have a homeless person dining with them that night. The celebrations also include a parade, and in it we find Plácido (Cassen), the humble owner of a three-wheeler, whose family is forced to live in a public lavatory because of the lack of money to pay the rent, and who has to pay the second bill of his vehicle before midnight or else he will lose it."
"Roving with his dazzlingly mobile camera around the decadent ballrooms, bucolic countryside retreats, urban bordellos, and painter's studios of late nineteenth-century French life, Max Ophuls brings his astonishing visual dexterity and storytelling bravura to this triptych of tales by Guy de Maupassant about the limits of spiritual and physical pleasure. Featuring a stunning cast of French stars (including Danielle Darrieux, Jean Gabin, and Simone Simon), LE PLAISIR pinpoints the cruel ironies and happy compromises of life with a charming and sophisticated breeziness."
"In this 1977 short film by Agnès Varda, Pauline and Darius explore the city of Isfahan, Iran."
"A Hollywood studio executive with a shaky moral compass (Tim Robbins) finds himself caught up in a criminal situation that would be right at home in one of his movie projects, in this biting industry satire from Robert Altman. Mixing elements of film noir with sly insider comedy, THE PLAYER, based on a novel by Michael Tolkin, functions as both a nifty stylish murder story and a commentary on its own making, and it is stocked with a heroic supporting cast (Peter Gallagher, Whoopi Goldberg, Greta Scacchi, Dean Stockwell, Fred Ward) and a lineup of star cameos that make for an astonishing Hollywood who's who. This complexly woven grand entertainment (which kicks off with one of American cinema's most audacious and acclaimed opening shots) was the film that marked Altman's triumphant commercial comeback in the early 1990s."
"Jacques Tati’s gloriously choreographed, nearly wordless comedies about confusion in an age of high technology reached their apotheosis with PLAYTIME. For this monumental achievement, a nearly three-year-long, bank-breaking production, Tati again thrust the lovably old-fashioned Monsieur Hulot, along with a host of other lost souls, into a baffling modern world, this time Paris. With every inch of its superwide frame crammed with hilarity and inventiveness, PLAYTIME is a lasting record of a modern era tiptoeing on the edge of oblivion."
"Shot in 1996, when director David Gordon Green was a student at the North Carolina School of the Arts, PLEASANT GROVE was the inspiration for GEORGE WASHINGTON. The film is presented here with commentary by Green, cinematographer Tim Orr, and actor Paul Schneider."
"A corrupt businessman blackmails the lovelorn reprobate Atsushi into watching over his suitcase full of embezzled cash while he serves a jail sentence. Rather than wait for the man to retrieve his money, however, Atsushi decides to spend it all in one libidinous rush, fully expecting to be tracked down and killed. Oshima's dip into the waters of the popular soft-core ""pink film"" genre is a compelling journey into excess."
A husband clashes with his wife over his membership to the Irish Citizen Army when she burns a letter informing him of a promotion.
"When ultra-respectable General Dumont discovers that his nubile daughter Agnes is ""A.D."", author of a scandalous under-the-counter novel, he wants her shipped to a convent; but she escapes to Paris, planning to live with her brother, ostensibly a rich artist but really a poor guide in the Balzac Museum. This misunderstanding gets both in serious trouble, and puts Agnes in immediate need of money...just the amount offered as grand prize in an amateur striptease contest, which her new boyfriend, reporter Daniel, is covering for his magazine..."
"A mysterious tradesman (Ivar Kants) shows up unbidden at the home of an academic couple (Judy Morris, Robert Colby) and proceeds over the next few days to disassemble their bathroom and related fixtures. The wife seems particularly disturbed by the man's presence and work habits, but both soon find the underpinnings of their intellectual lives and self-image being dismantled along with their pipes, walls, and ceilings in this offbeat Australian comedy."
"Les Blank considered this free-form feature documentary about beloved singer-songwriter Leon Russell, filmed between 1972 and 1974, to be one of his greatest accomplishments. Yet it has not been released until now. Hired by Russell to film him at his recording studio in northeast Oklahoma, Blank ended up constructing a unique, intimate portrait of a musician and his environment. Made up of mesmerizing scenes of Russell and his band performing, both in concert and in the studio, as well as off-the-cuff moments behind the scenes, this singular film—which also features performances by Willie Nelson and George Jones—has attained legendary status over the years. It’s a work of rough beauty that serves as testament to Blank’s cinematic daring and Russell’s immense musical talents."
"Water and lightning. Music and poetry. Life and death. An incantatory, visually sublime river journey that anticipates the cosmic mystery of KAILI BLUES."
"Presented here is the second film of Hollis Frampton’s seven-film Hapax Legomena cycle, the title of which means ‘things said one time.’ Frampton considered the works in the cycle to be interrelated, but also to be ‘detachable parts.’"
"POETRY IN MOTION is an unprecedented anthology of twenty-four leading North American poets who sing, chant, and anything but “read” their work in an energetic celebration of the form’s oral tradition that spans from the Beat Generation to the 1980s downtown New York scene. Charles Bukowski, Anne Waldman, John Giorno, Ntozake Shange, Tom Waits, Helen Adam, Jim Carroll, and William S. Burroughs are among the luminaries who prove that verse is alive and thriving in the modern age."
"Julien Duvivier remade his own silent adaptation of a popular turn-of-the-twentieth-century novella and play for the sound era, resulting in one of his most beloved films. In a tremendously moving performance, Robert Lynen plays the neglected young François, mockingly called Poil de Carotte (Carrottop) by his family for his mop of red hair. Duvivier sensitively charts the rural daily life of a boy desperate to connect with others, especially his distracted father, played by the chameleonic Harry Baur."
"The great Agnès Varda’s film career began with this graceful, penetrating study of a marriage on the rocks, set against the backdrop of a small Mediterranean fishing village. Both a stylized depiction of the complicated relationship between a married couple (played by Silvia Monfort and Philippe Noiret) and a documentary-like look at the daily struggles of the locals, Varda’s discursive, gorgeously filmed debut was radical enough to later be considered one of the progenitors of the coming French New Wave."
"The writer, actor, and director Sacha Guitry emerged from the theater to become one of France’s best-known and most inventive filmmakers, and LA POISON marked his first major collaboration with another titan of the screen, the incomparably expressive Michel Simon. With Guitry’s witty dialogue and fleet pacing, this black comedy is the quintessential depiction of a marriage gone sour: after thirty years together, a village gardener (Simon) and his wife (Germaine Reuver) find themselves contemplating how to do away with each other, with the former even planning how he’ll negotiate his eventual criminal trial. Inspired by Guitry’s own post–World War II tangle with the law—a wrongful charge of collaborationism—LA POISON is a blithely caustic broadside against the French legal system and a society all too eager to capitalize on the misfortunes of others."
"Maurice Pialat’s subversive take on the policier stars Gérard Depardieu as a tough Parisian detective known for his hard-nosed interrogation tactics. When he finds himself drawn to a drug dealer’s girlfriend (Sophie Marceau) who also happens to be a suspect in a Tunisian drug-smuggling syndicate, his rigorous code of honor is put to the test. Written by Catherine Breillat, this explosive human drama delves fearlessly into a complex moral no-man’s land as it exposes the often-thin line that separates authority from criminality."
"The jaw-dropping set pieces fly fast and furious in Jackie Chan’s breathtakingly inventive martial-arts comedy, a smash hit that made him a worldwide icon of daredevil action spectacle. The director/star/one-man stunt machine plays Ka-Kui, a Hong Kong police inspector who goes rogue to bring down a drug kingpin and protect the case’s star witness (Chinese cinema legend Brigitte Lin) from retribution. Packed wall-to-wall with charmingly goofball slapstick and astoundingly acrobatic fight choreography—including an epic shopping-mall melee of flying fists and shattered glass—POLICE STORY set a new standard for rock-’em-sock-’em mayhem that would influence a generation of filmmakers from Hong Kong to Hollywood."
"Jackie Chan followed up the massive success of POLICE STORY with an even bigger box-office hit. Having been demoted to a lowly traffic cop for his, ahem, unorthodox policing methods, Chan’s go-it-alone officer Ka-Kui quits the force in protest. But it isn’t long before he’s back in action, racing the clock to stop a band of serial bombers and win back his much-put-upon girlfriend May (the phenomenal Maggie Cheung, reprising her star-making role). Boasting epic explosions, an awesomely 1980s electro soundtrack, and a showstopping finale—which turns an abandoned warehouse into a life-size pinball machine of cascading oil drums, collapsing scaffolds, and shooting fireworks—POLICE STORY 2 confirmed Chan’s status as a performer of unparalleled grace and daring."
"Subu makes pornographic films. He sees nothing wrong with it. They are an aid to a repressed society, and he uses the money to support his landlady, Haru, and her family. From time to time, Haru shares her bed with Subu, though she believes her dead husband, reincarnated as a carp, disapproves. Director Shohei Imamura has always delighted in the kinky exploits of lowlifes, and in this 1966 classic, he finds subversive humor in the bizarre dynamics of Haru, her Oedipal son, and her daughter, the true object of her pornographer-boyfriend’s obsession. Imamura’s comic treatment of such taboos as voyeurism and incest sparked controversy when the film was released, but THE PORNOGRAPHERS has outlasted its critics, and now seems frankly ahead of its time."
"On a winter night in Paris after the liberation, Jean Diego will meet a long lost comrade, villains of the war, a prophesizing tramp, and the most beautiful woman in the world. Directed by Marcel Carné."
"In Ingmar Bergman's PORT OF CALL, Berit, a suicidal young woman living in a working-class port town, unexpectedly falls for Gösta, a sailor on leave. Haunted by a troubled past and held in a vice grip by her domineering mother, Berit begins to hope that her relationship with Gösta might save her from self-destruction."
"On the night of December 2, 1966, Shirley Clarke and a tiny crew convened in her apartment at the Hotel Chelsea to make a film. For twelve straight hours, they filmed the one-and-only Jason Holliday as he spun tales, sang, donned costumes, and reminisced about good times and bad behavior as a gay hustler and aspiring cabaret performer. The result is a mesmerizing portrait of a remarkable, charming, and tortured man who is by turns hilarious and heartbreaking."
"An unscrupulous couple plans to take advantage of the artist who rents them a room, but his kind personality soon catches them offguard. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
"When young Domenico (Sandro Panseri) ventures from the small village of Meda to Milan in search of employment, he finds himself on the bottom rung of the bureaucratic ladder in a huge, faceless company. The prospects are daunting, but Domenico finds reason for hope in the fetching Antonietta (Loredana Detto). A tender coming-of-age story and a sharp observation of dehumanizing corporate enterprise, Ermanno Olmi’s IL POSTO is a touching and hilarious tale of one young man’s stumbling entrance into the perils of modern adulthood."
"Sparks fly as racial, sexual, and social politics intermingle at a lesbian potluck."
"Grace and Virginia are young San Diego twins who speak unlike anyone else. With little exposure to the outside world, the two girls have created a private form of communication that's an amalgam of the distinctive English dialects they hear at home. Jean-Pierre Gorin's polyphonic nonfiction investigation of this phenomenon looks at the family from a variety of angles, with the director taking on the role of a sort of sociological detective. It's a delightful and absorbing study of words and faces, mass media and personal isolation, and America's odd margins."
"Buddy Red Bow is struggling, in the face of persecution, by greedy developers and political in-fighting, to keep his nation on a Montana Cheyenne Reservation financially solvent and independent. Philbert, a simple-minded friend of Buddy's, ardently pursues Native American/First Nation wisdom and lore wherever he can find it--even on Bonanza--in order to earn his warrior name. He's even got his war pony, Protector: a beat-up old wreck of a car. Buddy's sister has been arrested in Santa Fe, and together Buddy and Philbert set off on a road trip to look after her kids and go bail her out. However, Bonnie's arrest has something strange about it as her friend Rabbit points out. As the miles roll by, Philbert's faith challenges Buddy's hard-edged view of the world (and occasional bout of reckless violence), and together they face the realities and dreams of being Cheyenne in the modern-day US as they fight to free Bonnie and her children and elude the Feds."
"PREMATURE tells the story of Norwegian Martin and his pregnant Spanish girlfriend, Lucia. We follow the pair during their first 15 minutes on Norwegian soil, observing Lucia's first encounter with this new culture and her in‚Äêlaws. The film depicts a car trip full of social tensions, expectations and misunderstandings."
"David Hamilton is principally known as a photographer, primarily for his soft-focus work on young women, but he has done five feature films -- PREMIERS DESIRS (1984) is his latest, to date, and proves once again that Hamilton knows how to photograph nubile young women in situations that are, at once, innocent and provocative. As with most of his other work, PREMIERS DESIRS is a coming-of-age drama about a group of teenage girls who leave their private school on an idyllic resort island, lose their boat, and embark on a series of romantic/erotic adventures."
Police discover a naked dead body.
Walter and Charlotte are a young couple who engage in an awkward conversation before Charlotte is set to take a train out of town.
"Before TINY FURNITURE, director Lena Dunham made a number of short films, one of which is presented here."
"Robert Drew's groundbreaking 1960 film PRIMARY is one of the most important and influential documentaries in the history of the medium. A pioneering work in the documentary movement that came to be known as cinéma vérité, PRIMARY follows the young charismatic senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy, as he goes head-to-head with established Minnesota senator Hubert Humphrey to win the Wisconsin presidential primary in April 1960."
"This luminous coming-of-age journey follows sixteen-year-old athlete Cyd (Jessie Pinnick) as she heads to Chicago to spend a languorous summer with her novelist aunt (Rebecca Spence). Eager to escape life with her depressive single father, the brash, self-confident Cyd quickly strikes up a relationship with the androgynous Katie (Malic White), while she and her aunt gently challenge each other in the realms of sex and spirit. Drawing richly naturalistic performances from his female-led cast, director Stephen Cone crafts an uncommonly wise and tender portrait of a young woman in the chrysalis-stage process of becoming herself."
"When a husband and wife discover a baby girl in a strange, golden pod next to the grave of their daughter, they decide to adopt her. It is not until years later, when she has chosen a suitor, that her mysterious origins and destiny are revealed..."
"In this rare color Mizoguchi film, the Emperor of China falls in love with a woman being groomed by a family of treacherous aristocrats."
"The contemporary American police state shapes almost every aspect of society—whether we’re aware of it or not. Without ever venturing inside a penitentiary, director Brett Story excavates the insidious, often-unseen influence that prisons—and the American system of mass incarceration—has on communities and industries all around us. From a blazing California mountainside where female prisoners fight raging wildfires to a Bronx warehouse that specializes in prison-approved care packages to an Appalachian coal town betting its future on the promise of new prison jobs to the street where Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson, this remarkably clear-eyed documentary sheds new light on how a system built on exploitation and racial injustice became woven into the fabric of everyday American life."
A married couple become involved in the underground bacon market of post-war Britain.
"Douglas Fairbanks Sr. makes his big-screen swan song with Korda's deliciously satiric deflation of the Don Juan myth. After having faked his own death and escaped Seville, the aging lothario returns, only to find that he has been promptly forgotten; perhaps Merle Oberon's raven-haired beauty can coax him back into business. DON JUAN was a rare ""talkie"" for Fairbanks, and a shrewd poking at the actor's own persona."
"Charles Laughton gulps beer and chomps on mutton, in his first of many iconic screen roles, as King Henry VIII, the ultimate anti-husband. Alexander Korda's first major international success is a raucous, entertaining, even poignant peek into the boudoirs of the infamous king and his six wives."
A 'song and dance unit' is assigned to entertain British troops in the Malayan jungle.
"One of the most narratively complex films by legendary dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer, PRIVILEGE shifts over its running time from a documentary about the experience of going through menopause to an autobiographical meta-film exploring the power dynamics underpinning experience, memory, and the manner in which women’s stories are told."
"“One of the striking things about [T.S. Eliot’s] ‘The Waste Land’ [...] is that it tends to shift decorum in every line. Of course, the possibility that a poem could look a different way in every consecutive line turned out to be a tremendously powerful tool for composition. [...] So I was coming from there, and, indeed, from a much more general context, part of which had recognized as an opposition violent shifts in decorum.” - Hollis Frampton"
"When an engineer from Tokyo arrives on an island inhabited by the Futori family, he is drawn into their primitive culture and superstitions. Directed by Shohei Imamura."
"LA PROMESSE is the breakthrough feature from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who would go on to become a force in world filmmaking. The brothers brought the unerring eye for detail and the compassion for those on society’s lowest rungs developed in their earlier documentary work to this absorbing drama about a teenager (Jérémie Renier) gradually coming to understand the implications of his father’s making a living through the exploitation of undocumented workers. Filmed in the Dardennes’ industrial hometown of Seraing, Belgium, LA PROMESSE is a brilliantly economical and observant tale of a boy’s troubled moral awakening."
"Jean Vigo was twenty-five when he made this, his debut film, a silent cinematic poem that reveals, through a thrilling and ironic use of montage, the economic reality hidden behind the facade of the Mediterranean resort town of Nice. The first of Vigo’s several collaborations with cinematographer Boris Kaufman (Dziga Vertov’s brother and a future Oscar winner), À PROPOS DE NICE is both a scathing and invigorating look at 1930 French culture."
"Adapted from the popular novel by Gabrielle Carey and Kathy Lette, this Australian coming-of-age classic is a frankly realistic look at the experiences of two teenage girls growing up in early 1980s Sydney. Determined to join the in-crowd of cool-kid surfers who hang out and hook up at the beach, lifelong friends Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Jad Capelja) give themselves over to a world of casual sex, drugs, and misogyny until they realize they want something more out of life: respect and equality. A refreshingly naturalistic answer to the raunchy sex comedies that were its Hollywood counterparts, PUBERTY BLUES subverts the teen-movie formula with a message of empowerment and self-determination."
"Alain Delon was at his most impossibly beautiful when PURPLE NOON was released and made him an instant star. This ripe, colorful adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s vicious novel “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” directed by the versatile René Clément, stars Delon as Tom Ripley, a duplicitous American charmer in Rome on a mission to bring his privileged, devil-may-care acquaintance Philippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) back to the United States. What initially seems a carefree tale of friendship soon morphs into a thrilling saga of seduction, identity theft, and murder. Featuring gorgeous location photography of coastal Italy, PURPLE NOON is crafted with a light touch that allows it to be at once suspenseful and erotic, and it gave Delon the role of a lifetime."
It’s the little things that really hurt in an epically demented battle between two relentlessly transmogrifying businessmen.
"A young girl spends the evening alone at home. She decides to have some sweet solo pleasure session, but not everything goes according to plan."
"Cranky Professor Henry Higgins (Leslie Howard) takes a bet that he can turn Cockney guttersnipe Eliza Doolittle (Wendy Hiller) into a “proper lady” in a mere six months in this delightful comedy of bad manners, based on the play by George Bernard Shaw. This Academy Award-winning inspiration for Lerner and Loewe’s “My Fair Lady” was directed by Anthony Asquith and star Howard, edited by David Lean, and scripted by Shaw himself."
A test pilot (Laurence Olivier) and a secret service operative (Ralph Richardson) must uncover the secret behind disappearing military aircraft and their crews.
"A sparkling four-way affair overflowing with dialogue that showcases writer-director Sacha Guitry's wit, Quadrille stars Guitry as a magazine editor whose longtime girlfriend, to whom he plans to finally propose, is uncontrollably drawn to a handsome American movie star. Meanwhile, a discerning reporter (Jacqueline Delubac) watches from the sidelines with amusement and provides the final corner to this romantic rectangle."
"Director Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s final film is a deliriously stylized tale of hothouse lust and simmering violence. Set amid an expressionistic soundstage vision of a French sea port, this daring adaptation of a novel by Jean Genet recounts the tragedy of a handsome sailor (Brad Davis) as he is drawn into a vortex of sibling rivalry, murder, and explosive sexuality. Completed just before Fassbinder’s sudden death at age thirty-seven, QUERELLE finds the director pushing his embrace of artifice and taboo-shattering depiction of queer desire to new extremes."
A squabble reveals the anxieties and generational differences within a New Orleans family displaced by Hurricane Katrina in this alternately comedic and casually profound video work.
Melodrama about the life of a mentally handicapped young man and his devoted sister after their famous novelist father and housewife mother go to Australia on a business trip.
Satyajit Ray's celebration of famed poet Rabindranath Tagore combines archival material with dramatized scenes from Tagore's biography.
"Bursting with the colorful street style and music of Nairobi’s vibrant youth culture, RAFIKI is a tender love story between two young women in a country that still criminalizes homosexuality. Kena and Ziki have long been told that “good Kenyan girls become good Kenyan wives,” but they yearn for something more. Despite the political rivalry between their families, the girls encourage each other to pursue their dreams in a conservative society. When love blossoms between them, Kena and Ziki must choose between happiness and safety. Initially banned in Kenya for its positive portrayal of queer romance, RAFIKI made history by winning a landmark supreme court case chipping away at Kenyan anti-LGBT legislation."
"In the directorial debut of actor Bob Hoskins, a young soldier defects after his sergeant is killed in battle. Shellshocked and mute, he joins a traveling gypsy caravan."
"Krzysztof Kieślowski began his career making documentaries. Presented here is RAILWAY STATION, one of his nonfiction shorts."
One girl. One car. One night. No coincidence.
"Bandits, gunslingers, outlaws: they know they can find refuge at the remote frontier outpost known as Chuck-a-Luck. There, in exchange for a 10 percent cut of any loot, former barroom belle Altar Keane (Marlene Dietrich) presides over a Wild West den of thieves. Among the newcomers at the hideout: Vern Haskell (Arthur Kennedy), who poses as an outlaw in hopes of smoking out the desperado who killed his fiancée. In his third and final western, Fritz Lang unsaddles the genre to create a tempestuous, sexually charged cult favorite that swaps expansive exteriors for roiling psychological interiors."
"A riveting psychological thriller that investigates the nature of truth and the meaning of justice, RASHOMON is widely considered one of the greatest films ever made. Four people give different accounts of a man’s murder and the rape of his wife, which director Akira Kurosawa presents with striking imagery and an ingenious use of flashbacks. This eloquent masterwork and international sensation revolutionized film language and introduced Japanese cinema, and a commanding new star by the name of Toshiro Mifune, to the Western world."
"In his directorial debut, Albert Brooks offers a bitingly satirical and remarkably prescient vision of the rise of reality television. He plays an ambitious director who moves his entire crew in with a “typical” American family in order to make a documentary about their “real life”—but before filming even begins, the project starts to go spectacularly awry. One of the first major mockumentaries ever made, REAL LIFE is a prophetic look at media spectacle and manipulation that introduced the world to Brooks’s one-of-a-kind comic sensibility."
"Tsai Ming-liang’s debut feature heralded the arrival of one of contemporary cinema’s most acclaimed and idiosyncratic auteurs. The striking first expression of the Taiwanese director’s recurring theme of urban alienation, REBELS OF THE NEON GOD centers on a directionless student (Lee Kang-sheng) as he becomes involved with a pair of petty criminals amid the arcades, roller rinks, and seedy hotels of the Taipei night world. Paying homage to a tradition of troubled teen pictures stretching back to Nicholas Ray, Tsai crafts a coolly stylized vision of lost youth adrift in a dead-end world."
"Chased from his apartment by a policeman, ne'er-do-well Rastus Jones (Sam Robinson) finds refuge in a Chinese laundry, where he wreaks havoc and has a memorable encounter with an improperly filled opium pipe. A RECKLESS ROVER pays homage to the slapstick tradition by introducing its own rendition of the Keystone Cops in its grand finale."
"A widow is pressured into taking care of a homeless war orphan. Bitter at first, she soon finds herself growing fond of the boy."
"Albert Lamorisse's exquisite The Red Balloon remains one of the most beloved children's films of all time. In this deceptively simple, nearly wordless tale, a young boy discovers a stray balloon, which seems to have a mind of its own, on the streets of Paris. The two become inseparable, yet the world's harsh realities finally interfere. With its glorious palette and allegorical purity, the Academy Award-winning The Red Balloon has enchanted movie lovers, young and old, for generations."
"A testament to the goodness of humankind, Akira Kurosawa’s RED BEARD (AKAHIGE) chronicles the tumultuous relationship between an arrogant young doctor and a compassionate clinic director. Toshiro Mifune, in his last role for Kurosawa, gives a powerhouse performance as the dignified yet empathic director who guides his pupil to maturity, teaching the embittered intern to appreciate the lives of his destitute patients. Perfectly capturing the look and feel of 19th-century Japan, Kurosawa weaves a fascinating tapestry of time, place, and emotion."
"Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1960s panoramas of contemporary alienation were decade-defining artistic events, and RED DESERT, his first color film, is perhaps his most epochal. This provocative look at the spiritual desolation of the technological age—about a disaffected woman, brilliantly portrayed by Antonioni muse Monica Vitti, wandering through a bleak industrial landscape beset by power plants and environmental toxins, and tentatively flirting with her husband’s coworker, played by Richard Harris—continues to keep viewers spellbound. With one startling, painterly composition after another—of abandoned fishing cottages, electrical towers, looming docked ships—RED DESERT creates a nearly apocalyptic image of its time, and confirms Antonioni as cinema’s preeminent poet of the modern age."
"Early in his career, the Austrian-born future Oscar winner Fred Zinnemann codirected with Emilio Gómez Muriel the politically and emotionally searing REDES. In this vivid, documentary-like dramatization of the daily grind of men struggling to make a living by fishing on the Gulf of Mexico (mostly played by real-life fishermen), one worker’s terrible loss instigates a political awakening among him and his fellow laborers. A singular coming together of talents, REDES, commissioned by a progressive Mexican government, was cowritten and gorgeously shot by the legendary photographer Paul Strand."
"Andrea Arnold’s provocative feature debut is a haunting exploration of voyeuristic obsession. Set amid the notorious, now-demolished Glasgow housing complex that gives the film its title, RED ROAD immerses the view in the world of a CCTV security operator (Kate Dickie) who is drawn into a dangerous web of intrigue when she begins compulsively watching a man from her past. Employing the methods of the Dogme 95 movement—including visceral handheld camerawork and natural lighting—this enigmatic thriller bristles with an eerie, tantalizing sense of anticipation."
"THE RED SHOES, the singular fantasia from Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, is cinema’s quintessential backstage drama, as well as one of the most glorious Technicolor feasts ever concocted for the screen. Moira Shearer is a rising star ballerina torn between an idealistic composer and a ruthless impresario intent on perfection. Featuring outstanding performances, blazingly beautiful cinematography by Jack Cardiff, Oscar-winning sets and music, and an unforgettable, hallucinatory central dance sequence, this beloved classic, now dazzlingly restored, stands as an enthralling tribute to the life of the artist."
"This haunting, lyrical documentary recounts the long untold story of gay men who were imprisoned on a remote island by Mussolini’s Fascist regime in the 1930s."
"Only a single reel of Richard Norman’s seafaring thriller REGENERATION survives, and that reel is almost completely consumed with nitrate decomposition. But watching the decayed images pulse and swirl, the viewer cannot help but contemplate the fragility of our cinematic heritage and recognize the importance of film preservation."
The Quay Brothers play with perception in this black-and-white nightmare machine of oscillating strings and unsettling puppets loosely inspired by an etching by Jean-Honoré Fragonard.
"Charles Laughton once again teams up with Korda for this moving, elegantly shot biopic about the Dutch painter. Beginning when Rembrandt's reputation was at its height, the film then tracks his quiet descent into loneliness and isolated self-expression, following the death of his wife to the unveiling of Night Watch to the ecclesiastical excommunication of his late-in-life lover and maid, Hendrickje Stoffels (played by Laughton's wife, Elsa Lanchester). Though black and white, Rembrandt is shot by cinematographer Georges Périnal (Le million, The Fallen Idol) with an attention to light that's particularly Rembrandtesque."
"Jacques Prévert co-wrote this atmospheric tale of the romantic trials of a tugboat captain, played by the iconic French star Jean Gabin. For André and the other members of the Cyclone's crew, existence is harshly divided between the danger of the stormy seas and the safety of life at home with their patient women. When André meets temptation in the form of the alluring Catherine during a risky rescue, he comes perilously close to betraying his wife of ten years. The haunting REMORQUES is distinguished by beautiful tracking shots and cunning special-effects work."
"RENDEZ-VOUS (1985) won director André Téchiné the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival, but it's also very much an actors' movie. The story, about a would-be actress's interwoven personal and professional life, gave Juliette Binoche a great showcase in her first lead role, while co-star Wadeck Stanczak was also honored by the French Academy of Cinema, and Lambert Wilson dominated the screen in all of his scenes as the more dangerous of Binoche's two would-be paramours."
"In one of Akerman's most penetrating character studies, Anna, an accomplished filmmaker (played by Aurore Clément), makes her way through a series of European cities to promote her latest movie. Via a succession of eerie, exquisitely shot, brief encounters, with men and women, family and strangers, we come to see her emotional and physical detachment from the world."
"Mikio Naruse's Repast (aka Meshi) (1951) is a domestic drama with an intact family at its center, at least at the beginning. Setsuko Hara portrays Michiyo, a loving wife whose five-year marriage to Hatsu (Ken Uehara) seems to be threatened by the visit of his young cousin Satako (Yukiko Shimazahi). The tension between them as her spouse seems to stray, and her decision about what to do, make up the substance of this intimate and beautifully acted drama."
"This 1975 short film by Agnès Varda was commissioned by the French television channel Antenne 2, which asked seven female filmmakers each to make a film in response to the question “What is a woman?”"
"In Jan Němec's surreal fable, a picnic is rudely transformed into a lesson in political hierarchy when a handful of mysterious authority figures show up. This allegory about oppression and conformity was banned in its home country but became an international success after it premiered at the New York Film Festival."
"Captain Hugh 'Bulldog' Drummond, a former British officer in World War I, grows bored with civilian life and decides to become a private investigator. Part James Bond, part Sherlock Holmes, Bulldog Drummond is never short on excitement. This time, Drummond leads a black-shirted platoon of men from his former unit against foreign interlopers trying to pull England into dangerous overseas entanglements."
Evald Schorm was one of the most politically outspoken of the Czech New Wave filmmakers. This raw psychological drama about an engineer unable to adjust to the world around him following his suicide attempt is at heart a scathing portrait of social alienation and moral compromise.
Maximilien de Robespierre seeks revenge on the Scarlet Pimpernel by kidnapping his wife.
"Orson Welles, playing himself, picks up a hitchhiker who recounts a strange story. Actors Micheál MacLiammóir and Hilton Edwards made this short film during a hiatus from shooting Othello (1952)."
"A gripping thriller and a tragic drama of nearly Greek proportions, REVANCHE is the stunning, Oscar-nominated international breakthrough of Austrian filmmaker Götz Spielmann. In a ragged section of Vienna, hardened ex-con Alex (the mesmerizing Johannes Krisch) works in a brothel, where he falls for Ukrainian hooker Tamara. Their desperate plans for escape unexpectedly intersect with the lives of a rural cop and his seemingly content wife. With meticulous, elegant direction, Spielmann creates a tense, existential, and surprising portrait of vengeance and redemption, and a journey into the darkest forest of human nature, in which violence and beauty exist side by side."
"A child is raised in Korea to avenge the death of his father’s first child in this decades-spanning tale of obsession and violence, the third collaboration between director Ermek Shinarbaev and writer Anatoli Kim. A study of everyday evil infused with philosophy and poetry, this haunting allegory was the first Soviet film to look at the Korean diaspora in central Asia, and a founding work of the Kazakh New Wave. Rigorous and complex, REVENGE weaves luminous imagery with inventive narrative elements in an unforgettable meditation on the way trauma is passed down through generations."
"Bill Plympton teamed with fellow indie cartoonist Jim Lujan for this wild-ride black comedy set in a sleazy 1970s Los Angeles, in which a low-rent bounty hunter named Rod Rosse, the One Man Posse, gets entangled in a web of danger when he takes on a job from an ex-biker/ex-wrestler turned U.S. senator named “Deathface.” The combination of Plympton’s visual imagination and the twisted humor of Lujan (who wrote the script and provides many of the voices) yields a blast of anarchic energy that proves that the transgressive spirit of underground animation is alive and well."
Amateur photographer Reverend Solomon Sir Jones used his 16 mm camera to capture candid glimpses of life in the African American communities of rural Oklahoma.
A leopard-print-clad Louis Armstrong appears in a dream sequence singing “I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead You Rascal You” and “Shine” in this jazz fantasy.
"In RICHARD III, director, producer, and star Laurence Olivier brings Shakespeare’s masterpiece of Machiavellian villainy to ravishing cinematic life. Olivier is diabolically captivating as Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who, through a series of murderous machinations, steals the crown from his brother Edward. And he surrounds himself with a royal supporting cast, which includes Ralph Richardson, John Gielgud, and Claire Bloom. Filmed in VistaVision and Technicolor, RICHARD III is one of the most visually inspired of all big-screen Bard adaptations."
"This 1962 short makes explicit Pier Paolo Pasolini’s themes of persecution and sacrifice while introducing an overtly political message; it also reflects a shift from neorealism toward a more symbolic and visionary style in his filmmaking. It got him sentenced to several months in prison for contempt of religion, although the charge was reversed."
"Working from a thoughtful script by Jack Nicholson, Monte Hellman fashioned this moody and tense western about a trio of cowhands who are mistaken for robbers and must outrun and hide from a posse of bloodthirsty vigilantes in the wilds of Utah. A grim yet gripping tale of chance and blind frontier justice, RIDE IN THE WHIRLWIND is brought to life by a compelling cast, including Nicholson, Cameron Mitchell, Millie Perkins, and Harry Dean Stanton."
"THE RINK, the eighth of twelve films Charlie Chaplin made for the Mutual Film Corporation, premiered in December 1916. In this popular two-reeler, Chaplin, as the Tramp, plays a waiter with unique tableside skills. It’s at the roller-skating rink, however, showing off his footwork on wheels, that he truly delivers."
"A quick-witted and compelling dramatization of the troubled marriage of Catherine II (played by German actress Elisabeth Bergner, in her English-language debut) to Peter III (a randy Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) and her subsequent ascension to the throne as Empress of Russia. With its luxurious renderings of the eighteenth-century St. Petersburg royal court and its nearly screwball evocation of Catherine and Peter's teasing relationship, THE RISE OF CATHERINE THE GREAT was a wise and worthy follow-up to HENRY VIII."
A judge interviews a group of actors who are under investigation for decency violations. Directed by Ingmar Bergman.
"Director Jean Renoir’s entrancing first color feature, shot entirely on location in India, is a visual tour de force. Based on the novel by Rumer Godden, the film eloquently contrasts the growing pains of three young women with the immutability of the Bengal river around which their daily lives unfold. Enriched by Renoir’s subtle understanding and appreciation for India and its people, THE RIVER gracefully explores the fragile connections between transitory emotions and everlasting creation."
"The Bengali filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak’s stunningly beautiful, elegiac saga concerns the tumultuous lives of people in fishing villages along the banks of the Titas River in pre-Partition East Bengal. Focusing on the tragic intertwining fates of a series of fascinating characters—in particular, the indomitable widow Basanti—Ghatak tells the poignant story of an entire community’s vanishing way of life. Made soon after Bangladesh became an independent nation, the elliptical, painterly A RIVER CALLED TITAS is a grand epic from a director who has had a devoted following for decades."
"When the youngest members of a family of farmers decide to become warriors, the clan's troubles multiply. Keisuke Kinoshita directs."
"Master director Luis Buñuel’s first color film (and first of only two he made in English) is a fascinating, unjustly neglected adaptation of Daniel Defoe’s classic survival novel. His take on the story—in which the eponymous shipwreck survivor (an Oscar-nominated Dan O’Herlihy) faces both physical and psychological peril while stranded for decades on a desert island—succeeds equally as a gripping adventure saga and as a subtly subversive, typically Buñuelian deconstruction of traditional notions of civilization, religion, and man’s place in the universe."
"Looking for opportunity, five brothers move north with their mother to Milan. There, Simone and Rocco find fame, in the boxing ring, and love, in the same woman. Jealousy mounts, blood is shed, and a striving family faces self-destruction in this incisive, sensuous, emotionally bruising masterwork from director Luchino Visconti. With an operatic Nino Rota score and Giuseppe Rotunno’s glimmering, on-location cinematography, ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS “represents the artistic apotheosis of Italian neorealism,” says A.O. Scott of the “New York Times.” Drawing from Dostoevsky and Thomas Mann, Visconti arranges his signature themes—modernity, class tension, familial discord—across an epic canvas that directly influenced later Italian-American sagas by Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese."
"Professor Jorge Serra Hamilton, an American scientist specialist in the atomic bomb, flees from their transcendental duties, in order to take shelter incognito and for a time in the idyllic Spanish village of Calabuch, a small village on the Mediterranean shores. Oblivious to the relevance of their occasional guest, local residents spend their time engaged in their modest daily chores. The affable professor Hamilton not only integrates perfectly into the small town of Calabuch, forging a deep friendship with its neighbors, but there he will find happiness he craved for."
"A young boy discovers that riding his new rocking horse enables his ability to pick the winners at the racetrack. His parents, who are deeply in debt, begin to rely on this newfound skill."
The music video for 'Rocky VI' by the Leningrad Cowboys.
A small Japanese mining village is besieged by giant caterpillars and flying monsters.
This twenty-minute documentary from 1969 follows champion bull rider Larry Mahan as he competes in the 1968 National Rodeo Finals in Oklahoma City.
"This was Roberto Rossellini’s revelation, a harrowing drama about the Nazi occupation of Rome and the brave few who struggled against it. Though told with more melodramatic flair than the films that would follow it to form The War Trilogy and starring some well-known actors—Aldo Fabrizi as a priest helping the partisan cause and Anna Magnani in her breakthrough role as the fiancée of a resistance member—ROME OPEN CITY is a shockingly authentic experience, conceived and directed amid the ruin of World War II, with immediacy in every frame. Marking a watershed moment in Italian cinema, this galvanic work garnered awards around the globe and left the beginnings of a new film movement in its wake."
"Simone Signoret, Anton Walbrook, and Simone Simon lead a roundelay of French stars in Max Ophuls’s delightful, acerbic adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler’s controversial turn-of-the-century play “Reigen.” Soldiers, chambermaids, poets, prostitutes, aristocrats—all are on equal footing in this multicharacter merry-go-round of love and infidelity, directed with a sweeping gaiety as knowingly frivolous as it is enchanting, and shot with Ophuls’s trademark mellifluous cinematography."
A group of masterless samurai living in Edo's red light district must fend off a militia bent on wiping out local prostitutes. Directed by Kazuo Kuroki.
"Ignoring the protests of his working-class mother, a young man becomes wrapped up in the world of delinquents and yakuza. Keisuke Kinoshita directs."
"What do a club devoted to model trains and the legendary film critic and painter Manny Farber have in common? These two lines intersect in Jean-Pierre Gorin's lovely and distinctly American film, which takes as its subject the desire to re-create the past (the locomotive aficionados' elaborate worlds in miniature, Farber's teeming canvases) and expands to something richly philosophical and surprisingly funny. ROUTINE PLEASURES is a masterful meditation on America's landscapes, real and imagined."
Jûzô Itami's debut short film RUBBER BAND PISTOL concerns the various activities of a group of friends.
"Considered one of the greatest films ever made, THE RULES OF THE GAME (LA RÈGLE DU JEU), by Jean Renoir, is a scathing critique of corrupt French society cloaked in a comedy of manners in which a weekend at a marquis’ country château lays bare some ugly truths about a group of haut bourgeois acquaintances. The film has had a tumultuous history: it was subjected to cuts after the violent response of the premiere audience in 1939, and the original negative was destroyed during World War II; it wasn’t reconstructed until 1959. That version, which has stunned viewers for decades, is presented here."
"Peter O’Toole gives a tour-de-force performance as Jack, a man “cured” of believing he’s God—only to become Jack the Ripper incarnate. Based on Peter Barnes's irreverent play, this darkly comic indictment of Britain’s class system peers behind the closed doors of English aristocracy. Insanity, sadistic sarcasm, and black comedy—with just a touch of the Hollywood musical—are all featured in this beloved cult classic directed by Peter Medak."
"This eye- and ear-opening documentary explores a profound, essential, and, until now, missing chapter in the history of American music: the indigenous influence. From the indelible first chords of Link Wray’s rock ’n’ roll landmark “Rumble,” Native Americans have had an enormous, though often overlooked, impact on the evolution of American popular music. Tracing the contributions of iconic Native artists like Charley Patton, Mildred Bailey, Jimi Hendrix, and Buffy Sainte-Marie, RUMBLE reveals a hidden musical history as told by the legendary artists who knew them, played music with them, and were inspired by them, including Quincy Jones, George Clinton, Martin Scorsese, Steven Tyler, and Iggy Pop."
"RUNNING FENCE depicts the long struggle by the artists, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, to build a 24 mile fence of white fabric over the hills of California disappearing into the Pacific. Cost: 3 million dollars. The idea at first must seem the limit of absurdity for the fence was taken down as planned at the end of two weeks and now exists solely on film. There is a struggle between the artists and the state bureaucracy, who want to prevent the fence being erected, even though the ranchers whose land it crosses want it. Opposition seems insurmountable."
"This film, directed by Richard Lester, was shot over two Sundays in 1959 for a cost of about seventy pounds. Nominated for an Oscar for best live-action short, it features Lester, Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, Graham Stark, and Bruce Lacey."
"A man receives a breakup letter from his sweetheart. The pained lover decides to reply, yet his writing utensils conspire to thwart him."
"Rusty Knife was the first smash for director Toshio Masuda, who would go on to become one of Japanese cinema's major hit makers. In the film, Yujiro Ishihara and fellow top Nikkatsu star Akira Kobayashi play former hoodlums trying to leave behind a life of crime, but their past comes back to haunt them when the authorities seek them out as murder witnesses."
"One of the most important artists of our era, Ryuichi Sakamoto has had a prolific career spanning over four decades. From techno-pop stardom to Oscar-winning film scores, the evolution of his music has coincided with his life’s journey. Following the disaster in Fukushima, Sakamoto became an iconic figure in Japan’s social movement against nuclear power. As he returns to music following a cancer diagnosis, Sakamoto channels his heightened awareness of life’s fragility into the creation of a haunting new masterpiece. RYUICHI SAKAMOTO: CODA is an intimate portrait of both the artist and the man."
A Scotland Yard undercover detective is on the trail of a saboteur who is part of a plot to set off a bomb in London.
This 1956 short film by Jacques Demy documents a week in the life of a clog maker in the Loire Valley.
"The charming, cocksure Saoud rules his neighborhood in Saint Etienne, France—until word spreads that he has stolen money from his mosque’s cashbox. As tensions escalate, Saoud must fight to save his reputation and avoid becoming a pariah in his own community."
"Nobuhiko Obayashi, director of the cult horror/comedy HOUSE, gives his unique spin on the true story of Sada Abe, who strangled her lover and cut off his genitalia as a keepsake. Nagisa Oshima used the same notorious incident as the basis of his controversial IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES."
"The comic genius of silent star Harold Lloyd is eternal. Chaplin is the sweet innocent, Keaton the stoic outsider, but Lloyd—the modern guy striving for success—is us. And with its torrent of perfectly executed gags and astonishing stunts, SAFETY LAST! is the perfect introduction to him. Lloyd plays a small-town bumpkin trying to make it in the big city, who finds employment as a lowly department-store clerk. He comes up with a wild publicity stunt to draw attention to the store, resulting in an incredible feat of derring-do on his part that gets him started on the climb to success. Laugh-out-loud funny and jaw-dropping in equal measure, SAFETY LAST! is a movie experience par excellence, anchored by a genuine legend."
"A daring but reckless minister (Lars Hanson) is defrocked and forced to leave town. He attempts to piece his life back together after becoming a tutor to a wealthy countess’s stepdaughter, but the countess has her own plan."
"This radically influential portrait of American dreams and disillusionment from Direct Cinema pioneers David Maysles, Albert Maysles, and Charlotte Zwerin captures, with indelible humanity, the worlds of four dogged door-to-door Bible salesmen as they travel from Boston to Florida on a seemingly futile quest to sell luxury editions of the Good Book to working-class Catholics. A vivid evocation of midcentury malaise that unfolds against a backdrop of cheap motels, smoky diners, and suburban living rooms, SALESMAN assumes poignant dimensions as it uncovers the way its subjects’ fast-talking bravado masks frustration, disappointment, and despair. Revolutionizing the art of nonfiction storytelling with its nonjudgmental, observational style, this landmark documentary is one of the most penetrating films ever made about how deeply embedded consumerism is in America’s sense of its own values."
"With his documentary on XIX Olympic Winter Games Salt Lake City 2002, Bud Greenspan shows that the Olympic Games set the bar to such a near-mythical level that winning or losing a medal can arouse emotions far beyond those in other competitions."
"Released the same year as PARIS IS BURNING, Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio’s THE SALT MINES focuses on three homeless Lantinx trans women living in a parking lot of old garbage trucks on Manhattan’s West Side. Aiken and Aparicio document the daily life and hardships faced by these women living on the margins of society."
"Agnès Varda constructed this invigorating travelogue from over four hundred still photographs taken during a trip to Cuba in the wake of its 1959 revolution. Through fluid montage, the people captured by her camera come to playful, loving life."
"July 5, 1950—Sicilian bandit Salvatore Giuliano’s bullet-riddled corpse is found facedown in a courtyard in Castelvetrano, a handgun and rifle by his side. Local and international press descend upon the scene, hoping to crack open the true story behind the death of this young man, who, at the age of twenty-seven, had already become Italy’s most wanted criminal and celebrated hero. Filming in the exact locations and enlisting a cast of native Sicilians once impacted by the real Giuliano, director Francesco Rosi harnessed the facts and myths surrounding the true story of the bandit’s death to create a startling exposé of Sicily and the tangled relations between its citizens, the Mafia, and government officials. A groundbreaking work of political filmmaking, Salvatore Giuliano established Rosi’s reputation and assured his place in cinema history."
"In a career-defining performance, Alain Delon plays Jef Costello, a contract killer with samurai instincts. After carrying out a flawlessly planned hit, Jef finds himself caught between a persistent police investigator and a ruthless employer, and not even his armor of fedora and trench coat can protect him. An elegantly stylized masterpiece of cool by maverick director Jean‑Pierre Melville, LE SAMOURAÏ is a razor-sharp cocktail of 1940s American gangster cinema and 1960s French pop culture—with a liberal dose of Japanese lone-warrior mythology."
"Toshiro Mifune furiously embodies swordsman Musashi Miyamoto as he comes into his own in the action-packed middle section of the Samurai Trilogy. DUEL AT ICHIJOJI TEMPLE furthers Miyamoto along his path to spiritual enlightenment, as well as further from the arms of the two women who love him: loyal Otsu (Kaoru Yachigusa) and conniving yet tragic Akemi (Mariko Okada). The film also brings him face to face with hordes of rivals intent on cutting him down, especially his legendary rival Kojiro (Koji Tsuruta). The titular climax is one of Japanese cinema’s most rousingly choreographed conflicts, intensified by Jun Yasumoto’s color cinematography and Ikuma Dan’s triumphant score."
"A disillusioned Musashi Miyamoto (Toshiro Mifune) has turned his back on the samurai life, becoming a farmer in a remote village, while his nemesis Kojiro (Koji Tsuruta) now works for the shogun. Circumstances bring them back together for one final face-off. Though it’s marked by a memorably intense final battle sequence, the rousing conclusion to the Samurai Trilogy is engaged with matters of the heart as well, as Miyamoto must ask himself what it is that makes a warrior and a man."
"In the first part of the epic Samurai Trilogy, Toshiro Mifune thunders onto the screen as the iconic title character. When we meet him, Miyamoto is a wide-eyed romantic, dreaming of military glory in the civil war that is ravaging the seventeenth-century countryside. Twists of fate, however, turn him into a fugitive. But he is saved by a woman who loves him and a cunning priest who guides him to the samurai path. Though the opening installment of a series, this film, lushly photographed in color, stands on its own, and won an Academy Award for the best foreign-language film of 1955."
"Toshiro Mifune stars as Isaburo Sasahara, an aging swordsman living a quiet life until his clan lord orders that his son marry the lord’s mistress, who has recently displeased the ruler. Reluctantly, father and son take in the woman, and, to the family’s surprise, the young couple fall in love. But the lord soon reverses his decision and demands the mistress’s return. Against all expectations, Isaburo and his son refuse, risking the destruction of their entire family. Director Masaki Kobayashi’s SAMURAI REBELLION is the gripping story of a peaceful man who finally decides to take a stand against injustice."
Toshiro Mifune plays a large-nosed samurai who woos a princess in Hiroshi Inagaki's adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac.
"Years of warfare end in a Japan unified under the Tokugawa shogunate, and samurai spy Sasuke Sarutobi, tired of conflict, longs for peace. When a high-ranking spy named Tatewaki Koriyama defects from the shogun to a rival clan, however, the world of swordsmen is thrown into turmoil. After Sasuke is unwittingly drawn into the conflict, he tracks Tatewaki, while a mysterious, white-hooded figure seems to hunt them both. By tale’s end, no one is who they seemed to be, and the truth is far more personal than anyone suspected. Director Masahiro Shinoda’s SAMURAI SPY, filled with clan intrigue, ninja spies, and multiple double crosses, marks a bold stylistic departure from swordplay film convention."
A young journalist interviews an elderly woman about being forced into prostitution in Borneo at a brothel called Sandakan No. 8. Directed by Kei Kumai.
"Seeking out new avenues for his artistry, Paul Robeson moved his family to London in 1928. During the next twelve years, he headlined six British films, pioneering uncharted territory for Black actors and reaching a level of prominence unthinkable in Hollywood. Robeson's first British production, Zoltán Korda's Sanders of the River, however, ended up being an embarrassment for the actor, its story of an African tribal leader transformed into a celebration of the British Empire."
"Toshiro Mifune swaggers and snarls to brilliant comic effect in Akira Kurosawa’s tightly paced, beautifully composed SANJURO. In this sly companion piece to YOJIMBO, jaded samurai SANJURO helps an idealistic group of young warriors weed out their clan’s evil influences, and in the process turns their image of a “proper” samurai on its ear. Less brazen in tone than its predecessor but equally entertaining, this classic character’s return is a masterpiece in its own right."
"Kurosawa's effortless debut is based on a novel by Tsuneo Tomita about the rivalry between judo and jujitsu. Starring Susumu Fujita as the title character, Sanshiro Sugata is a thrilling martial arts action tale, but it's also a moving story of moral education that's quintessential Kurosawa."
"Kurosawa's first film was such a success that the studio leaned on the director to make a sequel. The result is a hugely entertaining adventure, reuniting most of the major players from the original and featuring a two-part narrative in which Sanshiro first fights a pair of Americans and then finds himself the target of a revenge mission undertaken by the brothers of the original film's villain."
"When an idealistic governor disobeys the reigning feudal lord, he is cast into exile, his wife and children left to fend for themselves and eventually wrenched apart by vicious slave traders. Under Kenji Mizoguchi’s dazzling direction, this classic Japanese story became one of cinema’s greatest masterpieces, a monumental, empathetic expression of human resilience in the face of evil."
"Chris Marker, filmmaker, poet, novelist, photographer, editor, and now videographer and digital multimedia artist, has been challenging moviegoers, philosophers, and himself for years with his complex queries about time, memory, and the rapid advancement of life on this planet. SANS SOLEIL is his mind-bending free-form travelogue that journeys from Africa to Japan."
We all think of Santa as “Jolly Old St. Nick.” But who knew that he has a hidden dark side? Bill Plympton uncovers Kris Kringle’s flirtation with politics and greed.
"A beautiful female college student is found dead in a public park; the police soon discover that her murder may have been racially motivated. Basil Dearden's bold, direct police procedural, starring Nigel Patrick as the detective in charge of the investigation, is a devastating look at the way bigotry crosses class divides, and a snapshot of the increasingly interracial culture of England in the late fifties."
"Masahiro Shinoda's interest in sports and experience as an athlete, he was a long-distance runner, made him an ideal choice to direct the official film of the XI Olympic Winter Games Sapporo 1972. His work is marked by its gravitas, and this can be felt in the opening Torch Relay sequence. Few Olympic films can boast such aesthetically pleasing images as this one. Shinoda takes full advan- tage of the 'Scope format, and of the superb equipment at his disposal. Allied to this is a subtle use of sound and silence, filtering out all extraneous noise when required."
"A famous poet who hasn't written a word in two years unconsciously plagarizes the work of Stefan George, he comes to believe he is the reincarnation of the dead writer."
"One of the towering achievements of modern cinema, Béla Tarr’s newly restored magnum opus, based on the novel by László Krasznahorkai, follows members of a small, defunct agricultural collective who set out to leave their village on the heels of a financial windfall. As a few of the townspeople secretly conspire to abscond with all of the earnings themselves, a mysterious character, long thought dead, returns to the village, altering the course of everyone’s lives. Shot in exquisite monochrome and composed in arresting long takes, SÁTÁNTANGÓ unfolds in twelve distinct movements, alternating forward and backward in time, echoing the structure of a tango dance. Tarr’s monumental vision, aided by longtime partner and collaborator Ágnes Hranitzky, is enthralling, and his immersive evocation of rural Hungary as a postapocalyptic world of boozy dance parties, treachery, and near-perpetual rainfall is both transfixing and uncompromising."
"Arthur Seaton is a 22-year-old factory worker in Nottingham, a sprawling industrial city in the British Midlands. All week long he works hard at his lathe, asking and expecting nothing more than his weekly pay; but on Saturday evenings he asserts his independence by drinking, brawling, and playing practical jokes at the local pub."
"Directed by and starring Chantal Akerman, this short film was made when she was just eighteen."
"Ingmar Bergman presents the battle of the sexes as a ramshackle, grotesque carnival of humiliation in SAWDUST AND TINSEL, one of the master’s most vivid early works and his first of many collaborations with the great cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The story of the charged relationship between a turn-of-the-twentieth-century circus owner (Åke Grönberg) and his younger mistress (Harriet Andersson), a horseback rider in the traveling show, the film features dreamlike detours and twisted psychosexual power plays, making for a piercingly brilliant depiction of physical and spiritual degradation."
"A handsome, suave Toshiro Mifune lights up the screen as painter Ichiro, whose circumstantial meeting with a famous singer (Yoshiko Yamaguchi) is twisted by the tabloid press into a torrid affair. Ichiro files a lawsuit against the seedy gossip magazine, but his lawyer, Hiruta (Kurosawa stalwart Takashi Shimura), is playing both sides. A portrait of cultural moral decline, Scandal is also a compelling courtroom drama and a moving tale of human redemption."
"“If you talk of art, I consider A SCANDAL IN PARIS my best picture,” declared director Douglas Sirk, whose adaptation of the memoirs of François Eugène Vidocq, the elegant thief turned chief of Paris’s police, combines devious wit, melodrama, and romance into sparkling entertainment. George Sanders is at his roguish, debonair best as he climbs from clever criminal through the ranks of early-nineteenth century French society, with seemingly nothing to stop him from the biggest heist of his career . . . except, perhaps, the charms of a young lady."
"Krzysztof Kieślowski embarked on one of the major careers in world cinema with this feature debut. Building on the director’s documentary background, THE SCAR is a richly observed story of community, politics, and ambition in a rural Polish factory."
"Prestige producer Alexander Korda applies his seal of quality to this rip-roaring swashbuckler, a rollickingly entertaining adaptation of the classic novel by Baroness Orczy, which introduced the widely imitated trope of a hero with a secret identity. Leslie Howard steps into the foppish finery of the seemingly ineffectual English aristocrat who, as his quick-thinking alter ego the Scarlet Pimpernel, rescues innocents from the guillotine during the French Revolution. Boasting a superb cast that includes Merle Oberon and Raymond Massey, this crackling adventure offers one of cinema’s most unique heroes: a charming, cheeky dandy with the heart of a lion."
"When a young woman (Lucia Moses) escapes from her abusive father (William E. Pettus), she is rescued by an aspiring composer (Harry Henderson), but encounters opposition from his class-conscious mother."
"Mikio Naruse closed out his career in 1967 with Scattered Clouds (aka Two In the Shadow aka Midaregumo), a mix of melodrama and tragedy involving two people drawn together in an socially impermissible relationship -- Yoko Tsukasa plays the wife who finds herself attracted to the man (Yuzo Kayama) who killed her husband in an accident. Between the quality of Tsukasa's performance (and her extraordinary beauty) and the presence of the near-iconic Kayama, the movie has more than its share of cinematic virtues, and makes a satisfying swan-song for the director, who died two years later."
"SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE chronicles the many years of love and turmoil that bind Marianne (Liv Ullmann) and Johan (Erland Josephson) through matrimony, infidelity, divorce, and subsequent partners. Shot in intense, intimate close-ups by master cinematographer Sven Nykvist and featuring flawless performances, Ingmar Bergman’s emotional x-ray reveals the intense joys and pains of a complex relationship."
"“Innocence and Panic”
"
"Fletcher Munson has a doppelgänger in dentist Dr. Jeffrey Korchek. In his only starring performance to date, acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh inhabits both roles: Munson, onanistic corporate drone and speechwriter for New Age guru T. Azimuth Schwitters, and the swinging Korchek, Muzak enthusiast and lover to Munson’s disenchanted wife. Meanwhile, mad exterminator and part-time celebrity prima donna Elmo Oxygen seduces local housewives in secret code and plots against Schwitters. Placing the onus squarely on the viewer (“If you don’t understand this film, it’s your fault and not ours”), writer/director/editor/cameraman Soderbergh presents a deranged comedy of confused identity, doublespeak, and white-knuckled corporate intrigue, confirming his status as one of America’s most daring and unpredictable filmmakers."
"This fifteen minute short, about a clumsy rural postman named Francois, was the first film Jacques Tati directed on his own; he also wrote and stars in it. Tati would reprise the role of Francois in Jour de Fete a few years later."
"Life in an English girls' reform prison is examined in this brutal picture written by Roy Minton, the person responsible for SCUM (1980), which tells the same story in a prison for boys. The film centers mainly on two girls--York, who longs for some sort of security behind the prison walls, and Cotterrill, a driven mother who desperately wants to be reunited with her child. The girls are from all walks of life but learn to survive together, fighting the system and often each other. Ex-Beatle George Harrison is executive producer. Released in Britain in 1982."
"The following is a short film that Hiroshi Teshigahara made in 1963. It documents the installation of a sculpture exhibition at the Sogetsu Institute by his father, Sofu Teshigahara."
Colorful underwater photography highlights this educational film about starfish.
"An American fisherman attempts to smuggle two Cuban immigrants into Miami, passing them off as day laborers. While the group trawls for shrimp, a fourth person boards the boat, carrying a secret at the bottom of the Ocean."
Jean Painlevé’s classic underwater short THE SEA HORSE uses dreamlike imagery to detail the lives of the titular upright-swimming creatures.
A 'psychic' (Kim Stanley) coerces her husband (Richard Attenborough) into kidnapping a young girl as part of a scheme to achieve fame by helping the police investigation.
"From 1927 to 1928, Jean Painlevé made his first three films aimed at the general public. Shown in ‘ciné-clubs’ and avant-garde movie theaters of Paris, these films were written and edited to entertain as well as educate. SEA URCHINS, one of these educational films, is presented here in its original silent version. (Presented without score.)"
Jean Painlevé delivers an intimate (and microscopic) view of sea urchins.
"On a road trip, distant cousins Naomi and Jo-Jo are left alone in a motel room. Without permission, the girls venture out into the night in search of soda, playing cards, and mischief."
"Two of golden-age Hollywood’s greatest and most beloved child stars bring the classic novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett to enchanting life. In her final role at MGM, Margaret O’Brien plays Mary, a young orphan sent to live at the dark and foreboding English estate of her embittered uncle (Herbert Marshall) and his temperamental, bedridden son (fellow juvenile virtuoso Dean Stockwell). There, Mary discovers the existence of a walled-off, overgrown garden, a secret little world that, as the children nurture it, brings a glimmer of hope to a broken family. The film’s sense of wonder is enhanced by the expressive cinematography, which blossoms from atmospheric monochrome to radiant color in an unforgettable moment of movie magic."
"Sequestered in his home, a disgraced President Richard Milhous Nixon arms himself with a bottle of scotch and a gun to record memoirs that no one will hear. He is surrounded by the silent portraits of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Kissinger, and his mother, as he resurrects his past in a passionate attempt to defend himself and his political legacy. Based on the original play by Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone, and starring Philip Baker Hall in a tour de force solo performance, Robert Altman’s SECRET HONOR is a searing interrogation of the Nixon mystique and an audacious depiction of unchecked paranoia."
"The winner of four César awards, including best picture and director, Abdellatif Kechiche’s THE SECRET OF THE GRAIN is a stirring drama about the daily joys and struggles of a bustling French-Arab family. It has the texture of a documentary but a classic, almost Shakespearean structure: when patriarch Slimane acts on his wish to open a portside restaurant specializing in his ex-wife’s couscous and fish, the extended clan’s passions and problems explode, leading to an engrossing, suspenseful climax. With sensitivity and grit, THE SECRET OF THE GRAIN celebrates the role food plays in family life and gets to the core of contemporary immigrant experience."
"Mike Leigh’s Palme d’Or–winning masterpiece charts the shockwaves that ripple through an already-fractured London family when Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a successful, adopted black optometrist, makes contact with Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn, winner of the best actress prize at Cannes), her desperately dysfunctional white birth mother, who is woefully unprepared to deal with the situation. With unexpected humor and gripping emotional realism, Leigh crafts an intricate, richly human exploration of the buried tensions and heartaches that run beneath the surface of family life."
"A master of intensely emotional human dramas, director Lee Chang-dong is a luminary of contemporary Korean cinema, and his place on the international stage was cemented by this stirring and unpredictable work examining grief and deliverance. An effortless mix of lightness and uncompromising darkness, SECRET SUNSHINE stars Cannes best actress winner Jeon Do-yeon as a widowed piano teacher who moves with her young son from Seoul to her late husband’s provincial hometown for a fresh start. Quietly expressive, supple filmmaking and sublime, subtle performances distinguish this remarkable portrayal of the search for grace amid tragedy."
"Shotgun weddings, kidnapping, attempted murder, emergency dental work, the things Don Vincenzo will do to restore his family’s honor! Pietro Germi’s SEDUCED AND ABANDONED was the follow-up to his international sensation DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE, and in many ways it’s even more audacious, a rollicking yet raw series of escalating comic calamities that ensue in a small village when sixteen-year-old Agnese (the beautiful Stefania Sandrelli) loses her virginity at the hands of her sister’s lascivious fiance. Merciless and mirthful, SEDUCED AND ABANDONED skewers Sicilian social customs and pompous patriarchies with a sly, devilish grin."
"Young Seide lives in a secluded mountain village in the heart of Kyrgyzstan. She loves her freedom to ride her horse, the closest soul she has, and enjoys playing with the village boys. When she is faced with the prospect of an arranged marriage, her family decides to honor tradition and kill Seide’s horse for the wedding celebration. Upset and feeling voiceless, Seide tries to understand her family’s decision but cannot let her horse be killed."
"The Japanese Organizing Committee responded frostily to Kon Ichikawa's TOKYO OLYMPIAD and decided a less 'frivolous' survey of the Tokyo Games should be made from the footage Ichikawa shot. More solemn, nationalistic, and orthodox than TOKYO OLYMPIAD, SENSATION OF THE CENTURY is the more comprehensive film The Japanese Organizing Committee desired."
"This lush, Technicolor tragic romance from Luchino Visconti stars Alida Valli as a nineteenth-century Italian countess who, during the Austrian occupation of her country, puts her marriage and political principles on the line by engaging in a torrid affair with a dashing Austrian lieutenant, played by Farley Granger. Gilded with ornate costumes and sets and a rich classical soundtrack, and featuring fearless performances, this operatic melodrama is an extraordinary evocation of reckless emotions and deranged lust, from one of the cinema’s great sensualists."
"Of all the films that the Korean Motion Picture Promotion Corporation created for the Games of the XXIV Olympiad, Lee Kwang-soo's SEOUL 1988 is the most comprehensive. The film devotes much footage to sports dear to Koreans but regarded as minor in international terms: archery, table tennis (appearing as an official discipline for the first time at the Olympic Games), and shooting. And it revels in arcane details such as the American Florence Griffith Joyner's spending sixteen minutes in makeup before each race and the need for shooters to hit the center of a target just one milli- meter in diameter."
"One of the most thrilling movie epics of all time, SEVEN SAMURAI (SHICHININ NO SAMURAI) tells the story of a sixteenth-century village whose desperate inhabitants hire the eponymous warriors to protect them from invading bandits. This three-hour ride from Akira Kurosawa, featuring legendary actors Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura, seamlessly weaves philosophy and entertainment, delicate human emotions and relentless action, into a rich, evocative, and unforgettable tale of courage and hope."
Michael Haneke's debut feature film chronicles three years in the life of a middle class family who have sinister plans.
"Returning exhausted from the Crusades to find medieval Sweden gripped by the Plague, a knight (Max von Sydow) suddenly comes face-to-face with the hooded figure of Death, and challenges him to a game of chess. As the fateful game progresses, and the knight and his squire encounter a gallery of outcasts from a society in despair, Bergman mounts a profound inquiry into the nature of faith and the torment of mortality. One of the most influential films of its time, THE SEVENTH SEAL is a stunning allegory of man’s search for meaning and a work of stark visual poetry."
"After attempting suicide, Francesca Cunningham (Ann Todd) hires Dr. Larsen (Herbert Lom) who, using hypnotism, delves into her subconscious in search of answers. Francesca recounts several failed romances to Dr. Larsen, shown in flashbacks, many of which were sabotaged by her cousin and musical tutor, Nicholas (James Mason), a jealous taskmaster who cares for Francesca deeply. As the subsequent veils are lifted from her clouded mind, Francesca is forced to confront her feelings for Nicholas."
"Krzysztof Kieślowski made more than twenty documentaries, including the following short. SEVEN WOMEN OF DIFFERENT AGES (1978) subtly portrays a range of ballet dancers, one each day of the week."
"Charles Burnett’s first film already displays the director’s neorealist, poetry-of-the-everyday style as it follows a group of friends over the course of an aimless day in Los Angeles.
"
"In eight minutes, animator Bill Plympton gives us twenty-four vignettes: seven are clearly about sex, ten about violence, and seven others deal with human frailties, particularly related to the body as it ages."
"Marall, a young girl, accompanies her parents to a dinner party where the strange social rituals of the adult world take an unsettling turn."
"John Cassavetes’s directorial debut revolves around a romance in New York City between Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), a light- skinned black woman, and Tony (Anthony Ray), a white man. The relationship is put in jeopardy when Tony meets Lelia’s darker-skinned jazz singer brother, Hugh (Hugh Hurd), and discovers that her racial heritage is not what he thought it was. Shot on location in Manhattan with a mostly nonprofessional cast and crew, SHADOWS is a penetrating work that is widely considered the forerunner of the American independent film movement."
"Lonely garbageman Nikkander (Matti Pellonpää) finds himself directionless after losing his friend and co-worker to a sudden heart attack; unlikely redemption comes in the form of plain supermarket cashier Ilona (Kati Outinen, in her first of many performances for Kaurismäki), with whom he begins a tentative love affair. Boiling down what is essentially a romantic comedy to a series of spare and beautiful gestures, Kaurismäki conjures an unexpected delight that finds hope blossoming even amid gray surroundings."
"When a married man begins an affair with a woman from his past, he comes to suspect her young son intends to murder him. Directed by Yoshitaro Nomura."
"Charting the eight-year run of Shakedown, a peripatetic black lesbian strip club in Los Angeles, director Leilah Weinraub attempts “to portray the before and after of a utopic moment.” Weinraub presents a world unto itself, shaped by the desires and pleasures of its community. Shot with the tenderness of a home movie, SHAKEDOWN captures the propulsive, dreamlike atmosphere of the club and achieves a stunning intimacy with its subjects."
"Redding, a venerable star of Memphis’s Stax record label, seduced the ""love crowd"" in one of his best, and last, performances. SHAKE! OTIS AT MONTEREY, feature the entire set of this legendary musician, a performance that has entered rock-and-roll mythology."
"This 52-minute film, made by Lasse Hallström in 1973, represents his first effort working with actors in an improvisational style."
"Directed by Ingmar Bergman, SHAME (SKAMMEN) is at once an examination of the violent legacy of World War II and a scathing response to the escalation of the conflict in Vietnam. Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann star as musicians living in quiet retreat on a remote island farm, until the civil war that drove them from the city catches up with them there. Amid the chaos of the military struggle, vividly evoked by pyrotechnics and by cinematographer Sven Nykvist’s handheld camera work, the two are faced with impossible moral choices that tear at the fabric of their relationship. This film, which contains some of the most devastating scenes in Bergman’s oeuvre, shows the impact of war on individual lives."
"A smart, hilarious, and self-reflexive look at the sexuality of a young black lesbian."
"Paul Bowles’s haunting novel receives a rich, sensuous adaptation courtesy of master director Bernardo Bertolucci. Looking to rekindle their lost passion, American couple Kit (Debra Winger) and Port Moresby (John Malkovich) venture to the Sahara Desert. Along for the journey is the pair’s friend George Tunner (Campbell Scott), who soon begins an affair with Kit. As they contend with the numbing heat of the desert and the fallout of an unexpected love triangle, the trio find their lives and beliefs challenged in unexpected ways."
"The hunchbacked sailor Johannes (Birger Malmsten) longs to escape his home on a salvage ship helmed by his cruel, drunken father (Holger Löwenadler)—and so does the captain himself, who is slowly going blind and planning to leave his wife and son for a music-hall performer named Sally (Gertrud Fridh). The family begins to unravel when the captain invites Sally to live on the ship, where she and Johannes form a tender connection. Told in flashback and inspired in part by French poetic realism, A SHIP TO INDIA marks a major evolution in Ingmar Bergman’s early filmmaking, demonstrating his gifts as a conjurer of beguiling images and a dramatist of lacerating emotions."
"In SHOCK CORRIDOR, the great American writer-director-producer Samuel Fuller masterfully charts the uneasy terrain between sanity and madness. Seeking a Pulitzer Prize, reporter Johnny Barrett (Peter Breck) has himself committed to a mental hospital to investigate a murder. As he closes in on the killer, insanity closes in on him. Constance Towers costars as Johnny’s coolheaded stripper girlfriend. With its startling commentary on racism and other hot-button issues in sixties America and its daring photography by Stanley Cortez, SHOCK CORRIDOR has had far-reaching influence."
"Made in 1980 for American and British markets, this film, comprising re-edited, English-dubbed material from the first two Lone Wolf and Cub films, became a cult sensation on its release."
"François Truffaut is drunk on the possibilities of cinema in this, his most playful film. Part thriller, part comedy, part tragedy, SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER relates the adventures of mild-mannered piano player Charlie (Charles Aznavour, in a triumph of hangdog deadpan) as he stumbles into the criminal underworld and a whirlwind love affair. Loaded with gags, guns, clowns, and thugs, this razor-sharp homage to the American gangster film is pure nouvelle vague."
"An inept Slovak peasant is torn between greed and guilt when the Nazi-backed bosses of his town appoint him “Aryan controller” of an old Jewish widow’s button shop. Humor and tragedy fuse in this scathing exploration of one cowardly man’s complicity in the horrors of a totalitarian regime. Made near the height of Soviet oppression in Czechoslovakia, THE SHOP ON MAIN STREET features intense editing and camera work which won it the Academy Award for best foreign film in 1965."
David Thewlis and Alison Steadman star in this 1987 short comedy by Mike Leigh about a romance between a hairdresser’s daughter and a young man who communicates only through one-liners.
"A shocking, powerful film expanded from episode V of Kieslowski's legendary Decalogue, A Short Film About Killing considers societal violence in its many forms through the story of an idealistic young lawyer and the brutal murderer he is called to defend."
"An expanded version of episode VI in Kieslowski's legendary Decalogue, this film examines love, longing and sex through the story of a young postal worker who spies on a promiscuous woman in an adjacent housing project."
"From the depths of a trench in war-torn France, Chaplin supplies a little levity to a stark situation as an American soldier dreams of one day becoming a WWI hero. A man can dream can't he?"
"A couple separates. Elisa got a job outside the country and Manuela, who lived with her five years, has decided not to accompany her. Unable to say goodbye, they spend the last morning together refugees under the shower water."
"Shozo is plagued by the needs of his ex-wife and his current one, but prefers the company of his cat. Directed by Shiro Toyoda."
"After a quick comic introduction, SHRIMP STORIES takes a detailed look at the lives of shrimp."
"An unsung miracle of American independent filmmaking, SIDEWALK STORIES reworks Charlie Chaplin’s slapstick classic THE KID for 1980s New York. Writer-director Charles Lane casts himself as a modern-day Little Tramp, a struggling artist living on the fringes of downtown New York who becomes the protector of a young girl whose father has just been murdered. Like Chaplin, Lane blends graceful physical comedy and heartfelt emotion to create a poignant, nearly silent look at the struggles of life on the streets."
"Ben Wheatley’s third feature is an unmistakably English black comedy that charts a misfit couple’s road trip as it evolves into a killing spree. Chris (Steve Oram) wants to show Tina (Alice Lowe) his world and he wants to do it his way—on a journey through the British Isles in his beloved Abbey Oxford Caravan. Tina’s led a sheltered life and there are things that Chris needs her to see—the Crich Tramway Museum, the Ribblehead Viaduct, the Keswick Pencil Museum, and the rolling countryside that accompanies these wonders in his life. But it doesn’t take long for the dream to fade. Litterbugs, noisy teenagers, and pre-booked caravan sites, not to mention Tina’s meddling mother, soon conspire to shatter Chris’s dreams and send him, and anyone who rubs him up the wrong way, over a very jagged edge."
"Two sisters—the sickly, intellectual Ester (Ingrid Thulin) and the sensual, pragmatic Anna (Gunnel Lindblom)—travel by train with Anna’s young son, Johan (Jörgen Lindström), to a foreign country that appears to be on the brink of war. Attempting to cope with their alien surroundings, each sister is left to her own vices while they vie for Johan’s affection, and in so doing sabotage what little remains of their relationship. Regarded as one of the most sexually provocative films of its day, Ingmar Bergman’s THE SILENCE offers a disturbing vision of emotional isolation in a suffocating spiritual void."
"Fatma and her mother are Kurdish refugees in Italy. On their visit to the doctor, she has to translate what the doctor tells to her mother but she keeps silent."
"Two Portuguese priests go to Japan to help Christian sects, driven underground by a ruthless magistracy, to regain a foothold. Quickly drawn into a mire of persecution, the missionaries learn the fate of an earlier mission. This film by Masahiro Shinoda was based on Shusaku Endo’s celebrated novel, which Martin Scorsese would also adapt decades later."
"Jean-Pierre Melville began his superb feature filmmaking career with this powerful adaptation of an influential underground novel written during the Nazi occupation of France. A cultured, naively idealistic German officer is billeted in the home of a middle-aged man and his grown niece; their response to his presence—their only form of resistance—is complete silence. Constructed with elegant minimalism and shot, by the legendary Henri Decaë, with hushed eloquence, LE SILENCE DE LA MER points the way toward Melville’s later films about resistance and the occupation (LEON MORIN, PRIEST; ARMY OF SHADOWS) yet remains a singularly eerie masterwork in its own right."
"On assignment for the mathematics department of le Palais de la Découverte, Jean Painlevé shot this film to be presented at the Paris museum’s 1937 international exhibition. SIMILARITIES BETWEEN LENGTH AND SPEED offers a mathematical look at proportions."
"SIMON OF THE DESERT is Luis Buñuel’s wicked and wild take on the life of devoted ascetic Saint Simeon Stylites, who waited atop a pillar surrounded by a barren landscape for six years, six months, and six days, in order to prove his devotion to God. Yet the devil, in the figure of the beautiful Silvia Pinal, huddles below, trying to tempt him down. A skeptic’s vision of human conviction, Buñuel’s short and sweet satire is one of the master filmmaker’s most renowned works of surrealism."
"SINCERE HEART (1953, aka MAGOKORO) was Masaki Kobayashi's second film as a director -- but as with his first, YOUTH OF THE SON, it is something of a hybrid work, influenced heavily by his longtime mentor Keisuke Kinoshita, who wrote the screenplay. The resulting film is a deeply passionate and sentimental drama about a young student (Akira Inshihama) who falls into a hopeless romantic attraction to an invalid girl (Keiko Awaji) whom he can only see from afar."
This four-minute short by Guy Maddin is excerpted from a film he created in 2010 for the opening of the Toronto International Film Festival’s Bell Lightbox building.
"In Oshima's enigmatic tale, four sexually hungry high school students preparing for their university entrance exams meet up with an inebriated teacher singing bawdy drinking songs. This encounter sets them on a less than academic path. Oshima's hypnotic, free-form depiction of generational political apathy features stunning color cinematography."
"A honey-voiced Bing Crosby makes a plan over the radio to elope with his sweetheart—but, alas, her father is listening too. This Mack Sennett–produced comedy features Crosby’s rendition of “Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea” and climaxes with a wild gorilla chase."
A college student receives a surprising offer to be a movie star. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"Margot Kidder is Danielle, a beautiful model separated from her Siamese twin, Dominique. When a hotshot reporter (Jennifer Salt) suspects Dominique of a brutal murder, she becomes dangerously ensnared in the sisters’ insidious sibling bond. A scary and stylish dissection of female crisis, Brian De Palma’s first foray into horror voyeurism is a stunning amalgam of split-screen effects, bloody birthday cakes, and a chilling score by frequent Alfred Hitchcock collaborator Bernard Herrmann."
"Sisters of the Gion follows the parallel paths of the independent, unsentimental Omocha (Isuzu Yamada) and her sister, the more tradition-minded Umekichi (Yoko Umemura), both geishas in the working-class district of Gion. Mizoguchi's film is a brilliantly shot, uncompromising look at the forces that keep many women at the bottom rung of the social ladder."
Six cartoon figures vomit repeatedly.
"Raised by a single mother on an isolated subdivision in rural Texas, fourteen-year-old Leila's deepest connection is with her pack of rescued dogs. On a hot summer morning, she wakes to find that her beloved pit bull Bubba has eviscerated a skunk. Leila heads to a nearby swimming hole to bathe him and meets Marco, a neighborhood boy with a chip on his shoulder. Charmed by his attention, Leila lets Marco into her world. But after a tense sexual encounter things spin out of control and Leila is forced to protect what she loves most at the cost of her own innocence."
"Sara Driver’s first feature is a tantalizingly enigmatic, surrealist fantasia rooted in the grit and anything-goes energy of the 1980s New York night world. When Nicole (Suzanne Fletcher), a young copy-shop employee, is hired to translate an ancient Chinese manuscript, she soon finds that the document has strange powers that exert an eerie influence over her life. As women go bald, people mysteriously die, and Xerox machines seem to develop minds of their own, Driver guides this hypnagogic reverie into increasingly hallucinatory, dreamlike realms, aided by the striking chiaroscuro compositions of cinematographer Jim Jarmusch."
"In this surreal comedy from Jacques Demy, Marcello Mastroianni plays a driving school instructor who, complaining of strange discomforts, learns he is four months pregnant. A frenzy of complications, scrutiny and celebrity ensues."
"In this film, made by Sativa Peterson in 1997, the narrator—a young radio DJ—contemplates the disappearance of twenty-three-year-old Pamela Ferguson, last seen leaving her job as a waitress at the Entré Restaurant in Winslow, Arizona."
"After the lavish Technicolor spectacle of THE RED SHOES, British filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger retreated into the inward, shadowy recesses of this moody, crackling character study. Based on the acclaimed novel by Nigel Balchin, THE SMALL BACK ROOM details the professional and personal travails of troubled, alcoholic research scientist and military bomb-disposal expert Sammy Rice (David Farrar), who, while struggling with a complex relationship with secretary girlfriend Susan (Kathleen Byron), is hired by the government to advise on a dangerous new German weapon. Deftly mixing suspense and romance, THE SMALL BACK ROOM is an atmospheric, post–World War II gem."
"After fifteen films that received mostly local acclaim, the comedy SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT at last ushered in an international audience for Ingmar Bergman. In turn-of-the-century Sweden, four men and four women attempt to navigate the laws of attraction. During a weekend in the country, the women collude to force the men’s hands in matters of the heart, exposing their pretensions and insecurities along the way. Chock-full of flirtatious propositions and sharp witticisms delivered by such Swedish screen legends as Gunnar Björnstrand and Harriet Andersson, SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT is one of cinema’s great erotic comedies."
"Susan Seidelman established her distinctive vision of New York City with this debut feature, the lo-fi original for her vibrant portraits of women reinventing themselves. After escaping New Jersey, the quintessentially punk Wren (Susan Berman)—a spark plug in fishnets—moves to the city with the mission of becoming famous. When not pasting up self-promotional flyers or hanging at the Peppermint Lounge, she’s getting involved with Paul (Brad Rinn), the nicest guy to ever live in a van next to the highway, and Eric (Richard Hell), an aloof rocker. Shot on 16 mm film that captures the grit and glam of downtown in the 1980s, with an alternately moody and frenetic soundtrack by the Feelies and others, SMITHEREENS—the first American independent film to compete for the Palme d’Or—is an unfaded snapshot of a bygone era."
"Directed by Mati Diop • 2011 • France

"After surviving the double suicide pact she made with her lover, a woman gives birth to their child."
"SNOWS OF GRENOBLE, which covers the 1968 Olympic Winter Games in Grenoble, is wide-ranging in its coverage, though it strives to capture the kinetic energy of the Games rather than attempting a detailed analysis, making viewers feel as though they are sharing the danger and excitement."
The keepers of an inn high in the Japanese alps are unaware that their three guests are actually fugitive bank robbers. Directed by Senkichi Taniguchi.
"Roberto Rossellini may have made SOCRATES (1971) for television, but he didn't let the small screen's budget and production limitations -- drawing on the few presumed facts known about the philosopher, and with fine central performances by Jean Sylvere and Anne Caprile, he ended up with a charming, visually stylized and engaging account of his subject's last days."
"Made in collaboration with its subjects, Chick Strand’s masterpiece SOFT FICTION gives five women the space to, in Strand’s words, perform “an exorcism of [an] experience.” Strand captures the slippery, vivid memories of erotic fantasy, confusing sexual encounters, addiction, incest, and historical trauma, laying bare narrative’s dual function of expressing and containing experience."
"François Truffaut followed up the international phenomenon JULES AND JIM with this tense tale of infidelity. The unassuming Jean Desailly is perfectly cast as a celebrated literary scholar, seemingly happily married, who embarks on an affair with a gorgeous stewardess, played by Françoise Dorléac, who is captivated by his charm and reputation. As their romance gets serious, the film grows anxious, leading to a wallop of a conclusion. Truffaut made THE SOFT SKIN at a time when he was immersing himself in the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and that master’s influence can be felt throughout this complex, insightful, and underseen French New Wave treasure."
"Ground control has been receiving mysterious transmissions from the three remaining residents of the Solaris space station. When cosmonaut and psychologist Kris Kelvin is dispatched to investigate, he experiences the same strange phenomena that afflict the Solaris crew, sending him on a voyage into the darkest recesses of his consciousness. With SOLARIS, the legendary Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky created a brilliantly original science-fiction epic that challenges our conceptions about love, truth, and humanity itself."
"This award-winning animated mind-bender is a by turns whimsical, mysterious, and psychotropic vision of deep-space discovery."
"A furious howl of resistance against racist oppression, the debut from Mauritanian director Med Hondo is a bitterly funny, stylistically explosive attack on Western capitalism and the legacy of colonialism. Laced with deadly irony and righteous anger, SOLEIL Ô follows a starry-eyed immigrant (Robert Liensol) as he leaves West Africa and journeys to Paris in search of a job and cultural enrichment—but soon discovers a hostile society in which his very presence elicits fear and resentment. Drawing on the freewheeling stylistic experimentation of the French New Wave, Hondo deploys a dizzying array of narrative and stylistic techniques—animation, docudrama, dream sequences, musical numbers, folklore, slapstick comedy, agitprop—to create a revolutionary landmark of political cinema and a shattering vision of awakening black consciousness."
"The debut feature from Věra Chytilová interweaves two stories simultaneously: one a narrative about a frustrated mother (Vera Uzelacová) discontented with the drudgery of housework, the other a quasi documentary about a gymnast (real-life Olympic gold medalist Eva Bosáková) training for a final competition before she retires. Taken together, they form a piercing portrait of women’s experiences in 1960s Czechoslovakia and a daring first expression of the feminist themes Chytilová would explore in subsequent works like DAISIES."
"In director Jun Fukuda’s second Godzilla outing, secret weather-control experiments create a radioactive storm and Godzilla must rescue monster hatchling Minilla from the giant mutant insects that result. Featuring a buoyant score by Masaru Sato and impressive wirework by special-effects director Sadamasa Arikawa, Son of Godzilla is lively, comic, and timely in its addressing of contemporary anxiety about worldwide food shortages."
"The ultimate Italian road comedy, IL SORPASSO stars the unlikely pair of Vittorio Gassman and Jean-Louis Trintignant as, respectively, a waggish, freewheeling bachelor and the straitlaced law student he takes on a madcap trip from Rome to Tuscany. An unpredictable journey that careers from slapstick to tragedy, this film, directed by Dino Risi, is a wildly entertaining commentary on the pleasures and consequences of the good life. A holy grail of commedia all’italiana, IL SORPASSO is so fresh and exciting that one can easily see why it has long been adored in Italy."
"Mikio Naruse's The Sound of the Mountain (aka Yama no oto) (1954) was one of the director's personal favorites among his own movies. The story itself concerns a woman, Kukiko (Setsuko Hara), trapped in a loveless marriage to Otto (Ken Uehara), living as a virtual servant to her in-laws -- the one solace she has is the sensitivity of her father-in-law (So Yamamura), who tries to better her life in increasingly bold ways. But matters become even more complicated when Kukiko finds herself pregnant, and decides to end the pregnancy without ever revealing her condition."
"Inspired by her love of William Faulkner and James Baldwin, director Chantal Akerman had planned to produce a meditation on the American South. However, just days before she was to begin filming, James Byrd Jr. was horrifically killed in a racist murder by three white supremacists in Jasper, Texas. Piecing together the details of the crime, Akerman offers an evocation of how the murder fits into a landscape and climate that is as much mental as physical."
"In this four-minute film from 2008, director Guy Maddin pays homage to a pug named Spanky."
"Haunting images and obsessive sexuality merge in this postmodern thriller about loss, love, power, and the distance that modern technology puts between us. The story of four people—an actor/gigolo (Michael McManus), a frustrated chambermaid (Arsinée Khanjian), an obsessed writer (Gabrielle Rose), and the film producer (David Hemblen) who manipulates them all—is filmed as if we were watching their power games through the lens of a surveillance camera. Disquieting and enthralling, SPEAKING PARTS confirmed Egoyan’s status as one of the most daring and original directors of his generation."
"Italian cinema dream team Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni are cast against glamorous type and deliver two of the finest performances of their careers in this moving, quietly subversive drama from Ettore Scola. Though it’s set in Rome on the historic day in 1938 when Benito Mussolini and the city first rolled out the red carpet for Adolf Hitler, the film takes place entirely in a working-class apartment building, where an unexpected friendship blossoms between a pair of people who haven’t joined the festivities: a conservative housewife and mother tending to her domestic duties and a liberal radio broadcaster awaiting deportation. Scola paints an exquisite portrait in muted tones, a story of two individuals helpless in the face of Fascism’s rise."
"SPEEDY was the last silent feature to star Harold Lloyd—and one of his very best. The slapstick legend reprises his “Glasses Character,” this time as a good-natured but scatterbrained New Yorker who can’t keep a job. He finally finds his true calling when he becomes determined to help save the city’s last horse-drawn streetcar, which is operated by his sweetheart’s crusty grandfather. From its joyous visit to Coney Island to its incredible Babe Ruth cameo to its hair-raising climactic stunts on the city’s streets, SPEEDY is an out-of-control love letter to New York that will have you grinning from ear to ear."
"The P-R-E-S-S-U-R-E is on as eight teenage spelling wizards set out to win it all at the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee in this acclaimed, marvelously entertaining documentary. Capturing both the behind-the-scenes trials and tribulations leading up to the big day and the high-stakes drama of the bee itself, SPELLBOUND introduces a host of uniquely unforgettable personalities as it wrings humor, nail-biting suspense, and surprising insight into the American psyche from a most unlikely subject."
"A look at the vitality of the Cajun lifestyle, paying special attention to the food, music and humor of the culture."
"Criterion is proud to present Víctor Erice’s spellbinding THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE (EL ESPÍRITU DE LA COLMENA), widely regarded as the greatest Spanish film of the 1970s. In a small Castilian village in 1940, in the wake of the country’s devastating civil war, six-year-old Ana attends a traveling movie show of Frankenstein and becomes possessed by the memory of it. Produced as Franco’s long regime was nearing its end, THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE is a bewitching portrait of a child’s haunted inner life and one of the most visually arresting movies ever made."
"Federico Fellini, Louis Malle, and Roger Vadim each direct a tale from Edgar Allan Poe in this haunting anthology film."
"Jackie Chan plus a gaggle of ghosts yields nonstop comic pleasures in this off-the-wall slice of supernatural slapstick. Chan is a class-clown martial-arts student at a Shaolin temple who gets a surprise lesson in an ancient fighting technique from some unexpected masters: five leotard-wearing, red-haired spirits who train him in the art of the “Five Style Fists.” The charmingly lo-fi special effects and supernatural storyline make this early Chan comedy an offbeat treat."
"When a wealthy, selfish family decides to take care of an elderly hobo who collapsed near their home, they are beset by visits from his numerous friends. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita."
Fiddling legend Tommy Jarrell shares his gifts with a new generation.
"During World War I, a German U-Boat captain is sent to Scotland on a spy mission, but he finds more than he bargained for in his contact, the local schoolmistress."
An alcoholic inspector (Edmund Lowe) goes undercover to find a dealer of stolen jewels who double-crosses the thieves who sell to him.
"This is where it all started. John Ford’s smash hit and enduring masterpiece STAGECOACH revolutionized the western, elevating it from B movie to the A-list and establishing the genre as we know it today. The quintessential tale of a group of strangers thrown together into extraordinary circumstances, STAGECOACH features outstanding performances from Hollywood stalwarts Claire Trevor, John Carradine, and Thomas Mitchell, and, of course, John Wayne, in his first starring role for Ford, as the daredevil outlaw the Ringo Kid. Superbly shot and tightly edited, STAGECOACH (Ford’s first trip to Monument Valley) is Hollywood storytelling at its finest."
"When a team of detectives loses the trail of a murderer, they decide to keep an eye on the suspect's ex-lover, who is trapped in an oppressive marriage."
"Andrei Tarkovsky’s final Soviet feature is a metaphys­ical journey through an enigmatic postapocalyptic landscape, and a rarefied cinematic experience like no other. A hired guide—the Stalker—leads a writer and a professor into the heart of the Zone, the restricted site of a long-ago disaster, where the three men eventually zero in on the Room, a place rumored to fulfill one’s most deeply held desires. Adapting a science-fiction novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Tarkovsky created an immersive world with a wealth of material detail and a sense of organic atmosphere. A religious allegory, a reflection of contemporaneous political anxieties, a meditation on film itself—STALKER envelops the viewer by opening up a multitude of possible meanings."
"For the follow-up to her acclaimed first feature, MY BRILLIANT CAREER, Australian New Wave leader Gillian Armstrong turned to a very different type of project: a gloriously over-the-top, shiny pop musical complete with outré costumes, high-energy dance numbers, and eye-popping production design courtesy of Brian Thomson (THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW). Desperate to break into the music business, teenage Jackie (Jo Kennedy) gets her shot at superstardom when her enterprising cousin (Ross O’Donovan) engineers a string of audacious publicity stunts that take the pair from their family’s pub to the stage of the Sydney Opera House. Featuring infectiously catchy tunes by Kiwi legends Split Enz, STARSTRUCK updates the classic “let’s put on a show” formula with a blast of irresistible, neon-bright exuberance."
"Costa-Gavras puts the involvement of the United States in Latin American politics under the microscope in this arresting thriller. An urban guerrilla group, outraged at the counterinsurgency and torture training clandestinely organized by the CIA in their country (unnamed in the film), abducts a U.S. official (Yves Montand) to bargain for the release of political prisoners; soon the kidnapping becomes a media sensation, leading to violence. Cowritten by Franco Solinas, the electrifying STATE OF SIEGE piercingly critiques the American government for supporting foreign dictatorships, while also asking difficult questions about the efficacy of radical violent acts to oppose such regimes."
"A western mining town, a fortune in gold, a beautiful lady crime boss, and the undercover investigator sent to flush her out: lust, deceit, and greed collide violently on the range in this dynamic frontier noir. Dispatched to investigate the murders of a pair of cavalrymen, Lieutenant John Haven (Dick Powell) lands a job as hired gun for the local saloonkeeper, the beautiful but ruthless Charlie (Jane Greer). Haven suspects Charlie of being the mastermind behind the murders as well as a plot to steal a shipment of gold, gathering evidence on her even as a dangerous attraction develops between the two."
"Alain Guiraudie’s startling follow-up to his international breakthrough STRANGER BY THE LAKE is a hypnotic, wondrously surreal odyssey through the continuum of human desire and sexuality. While on a journey of discovery in the south of France, filmmaker Léo (Damien Bonnard) drifts in and out of a series of relationships with men and women alike. When he conceives a child with the free-spirited shepherdess Marie (India Hair), who subsequently abandons both him and the baby, Léo suddenly finds himself alone with the daunting responsibility of raising a human being. Through a series of unexpected and unusual encounters, all while struggling to find inspiration for his next film, Léo will do whatever it takes to stay standing."
"When Sasha, a seven year old violin protégé, meets Sergei, a steamroller working in his neighborhood, he starts to open up from his strictly imposed routine of practice."
"The Steel Helmet marked Samuel Fuller's official arrival as a mighty cinematic force. Despite its relatively low budget, this portrait of Korean War soldiers dealing with moral and racial identity crises remains one of the director's most gripping, realistic depictions of the blood and guts of war, as well as a reflection of Fuller's irreducible social conscience. So controversial were the film's comments on domestic and war crimes (American bigotry, the Japanese-American WWII internment camps) that Fuller became the target of an FBI investigation."
"David Cronenberg’s first feature, 1969’s STEREO concerns medical experiments and telepathy and is a clear precursor to SCANNERS. The sixty-five-minute film, presented here, stars Ronald Mlodzik, who would go on to appear in Cronenberg’s CRIMES OF THE FUTURE (1970), SHIVERS (1975), and RABID (1977)."
"Jean Painlevé made numerous research films, strictly with the scientific and university communities in mind. THE STICKLEBACK’S EGG, an educational short about fish egg fertilization, is presented here in its original silent version. (Presented without score.)"
"The first entry in the Quay Brothers’ STILLE NACHT series is an eerie nighttime reverie composed in magnets, iron filings, and spoons."
"The third film of the STILLE NACHT series is an excursion into the dark, dreamlike forests of the Quays’ imagination."
A white rabbit and a child’s doll are choreographed to the ethereal tunes of experimental rock band His Name Is Alive.
"The lyrical, profoundly moving STILL WALKING (ARUITEMO ARUITEMO) is contemporary Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda's most personal work to date. Created as a tribute to his late mother, the film depicts one day in the life of the Yokoyamas, gathered together for a commemorative ritual whose nature only gradually becomes clear. Rather than focus on big dramatic moments, Kore-eda relies on simple gestures and domestic routines (especially cooking) to evoke a family’s entire life, its deep regrets and its daily joys. Featuring vivid, heartrending performances and a gentle naturalism that harks back to the director’s earlier, documentary work, STILL WALKING is an extraordinary portrayal of the ties that bind us."
"In her only film appearance, legendary blues singer Bessie Smith and the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra tell the story of a woman who is deserted by her boyfriend for a St. Louis floozy. Smith then delivers a soul-shaking performance of the title song, an elaborate ten-minute production number featuring dance sequences and backing vocals by the Hall Johnson Choir."
"Shohei Imamaura's debut film follows a man who joins a troupe of traveling actors, and becomes involved with one of the married actresses and her younger sister."
"Jean-Pierre Léaud returns in the delightful STOLEN KISSES, the third installment in the Antoine Doinel series. It is now 1968, and the mischievous and perpetually love-struck Doinel has been dishonorably discharged from the army and released onto the streets of Paris, where he stumbles into the unlikely profession of private detective and embarks on a series of misadventures. Whimsical, nostalgic, and irrepressibly romantic, STOLEN KISSES is Truffaut’s timeless ode to the passion and impetuosity of youth."
"This deeply affecting classic of the Australian New Wave is one of the most moving films ever made about the relationship between children and animals. Cut off from the world by his reclusive father (Peter Cummins), Mike (Greg Rowe), a lonely young boy, experiences an emotional awakening through his growing bonds with an orphaned pelican and Fingerbone Bill (David Gulpilil), an Aboriginal man estranged from his tribe. Lyrically shot amid the scenic splendor of South Australia’s coast, STORM BOY weaves a simple but profound fable about friendship and loss that’s beautifully attuned to the wonders of the natural world."
"One of a string of late-career masterworks made by Kenji Mizoguchi in the first half of the 1950s, A STORY FROM CHIKAMATSU (a.k.a. THE CRUCIFIED LOVERS) is an exquisitely moving tale of forbidden love struggling to survive in the face of persecution. Based on a classic of eighteenth-century Japanese drama, the film traces the injustices that befall a Kyoto scroll maker’s wife and his apprentice after each is unfairly accused of wrongdoing. Bound by fate in an illicit, star-crossed romance, they go on the run in search of refuge from the punishment prescribed them: death. Shot in gorgeous, painterly style by master cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, this delicately delivered indictment of societal oppression was heralded by Akira Kurosawa as a “great masterpiece that could only have been made by Mizoguchi.”"
"Considered Sacha Guitry's masterpiece, this fleet, witty picaresque about a gambler and petty thief is a whimsical delight. Guitry himself stars as the tricheur looking back fondly on a life of crime, which he narrates with an effervescence matched by that of the film's skillful editing and cinematography. With its rapid storytelling and novel use of voice-over, The Story of a Cheat has influenced filmmakers from Orson Welles to François Truffaut."
"Volunteering as a “comfort woman” on the Manchurian front, where she is expected to service hundreds of soldiers, Harumi is commandeered by the brutal Lieutenant Narita but falls for the sensitive Mikami, Narita’s direct subordinate. Seijun Suzuki’s STORY OF A PROSTITUTE is a tragic love story as well as a rule-bending take on a popular Taijiro Tamura novel, challenging military and fraternal codes of honor, as seen through Harumi’s eyes."
"In 1959, Yasujiro Ozu remade his 1934 silent classic A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS in color with the celebrated cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa (RASHOMON, UGETSU). Setting his later version in a seaside location, Ozu otherwise preserves the details of his elegantly simple plot wherein an aging actor returns to a small town with his troupe and reunites with his former lover and illegitimate son, a scenario that enrages his current mistress and results in heartbreak for all. Together, the films offer a unique glimpse into the evolution of one of cinema’s greatest directors. A STORY OF FLOATING WEEDS reveals Ozu in the midst of developing his mode of expression; FLOATING WEEDS reveals his distinct style at its pinnacle. In each, the director captures the joy and sadness in everyday life."
"This heartrending masterpiece by Kenji Mizoguchi about the give-and-take between life and art marked the first full realization of the hypnotic long takes and eloquent camera movements that would come to define the director’s films. Kikunosuke (Shotaro Hanayagi), the adopted son of a legendary kabuki actor who is striving to achieve stardom by mastering female roles, turns to his infant brother’s wet nurse for support and affection—and she soon gives up everything for her beloved’s creative glory. Offering a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes of kabuki theater in the late nineteenth century, THE STORY OF THE LAST CHRYSANTHEMUM provides a critique of the oppression of women and the sacrifices required of them, and represents the pinnacle of Mizoguchi’s early career."
"One of the ugliest (and least discussed) sides of wartime France is showcased in Claude Chabrol's Story of Women. Isabelle Huppert stars as an impoverished mother who achieves success and a better life for herself and her children by performing clandestine abortions in 1941 France, only to run afoul of the Petain government's brutal ban against abortion, which it regarded as a ""crime against the state."""
"There has never been a face quite like that of Giulietta Masina. Her husband, the legendary Federico Fellini, directs her as Gelsomina in LA STRADA, the film that launched them both to international stardom. Gelsomina is sold by her mother into the employ of Zampanò (Anthony Quinn), a brutal strongman in a traveling circus. When Zampanò encounters an old rival in highwire artist the Fool (Richard Basehart), his fury is provoked to its breaking point. With LA STRADA, Fellini left behind the familiar signposts of Italian neorealism for a poetic fable of love and cruelty, evoking brilliant performances and winning the hearts of audiences and critics worldwide. The Criterion Collection is proud to present LA STRADA, winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1956."
A kidnapped boy proves to be more than his abductor can handle. (Presented without score.)

"Two travelers—a man and a boy—whose car has broken down stumble upon a small roadside motel, where a girl offer to help them. At first all seems normal, but an unseen tension begins to mount between the three of them, leading to a startling discovery. Christopher Radcliff and Lauren Wolkstein’s award-winning short THE STRANGE ONES strips away the ordinary to offer a brief glimpse of a complicated, dangerous, and secret world lurking underneath."
"Satyajit Ray's valedictory film is a multifaceted character study that contains both humor and melancholy rumination. Based on the filmmaker's own story,The Stranger involves a bourgeois couple who are taken off guard when a man claiming to be the wife's long-lost uncle sends word that he will be coming to stay with them after years of travel. Though they fear he's an impostor, they tentatively let the man into their home, commencing an eye-opening emotional journey for the family. A humanist exploration of class, faith, and tradition versus progress, The Stranger is a bittersweet good-bye from one of the world's most important filmmakers."
"With this breakout film, Jim Jarmusch established himself as one of the most exciting voices in the burgeoning independent-film scene, a road-movie poet with an affinity for Americana at its most offbeat. Jarmusch follows rootless Hungarian émigré Willie (John Lurie), his pal Eddie (Richard Edson), and his visiting sixteen-year-old cousin, Eva (Eszter Balint), as they drift from New York’s Lower East Side to the snowy expanses of Lake Erie and the drab beaches of Florida, always managing to make the least of wherever they end up. Structured as a series of master-shot vignettes etched in black and white by cinematographer Tom DiCillo, STRANGER THAN PARADISE is a nonchalant masterpiece of deadpan comedy and perfectly calibrated minimalism."
"Following the back-to-back masterpieces of CITIZEN KANE and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, Orson Welles next applied his once-in-a-generation genius to the suspense film, crafting an unsettling postwar thriller that combined his baroque visual style with dark noir themes. Edward G. Robinson stars as Wilson, a government agent who tracks down wanted Nazi war criminal Franz Kindler (Welles) in a quaint Connecticut town, where he has managed to craft a new identity for himself as the respectable husband of Mary (Loretta Young), a local judge’s daughter. As Wilson closes in on Kindler, Mary is forced to confront the horrifying prospect that her husband may not be who she thinks he is."
"A bad day gets worse for young detective Murakami when a pickpocket steals his gun on a hot, crowded bus. Desperate to right the wrong, he goes undercover, scavenging Tokyo’s sweltering streets for the stray dog whose desperation has led him to a life of crime. With each step, cop and criminal’s lives become more intertwined and the investigation becomes an examination of Murakami’s own dark side. Starring Toshiro Mifune, as the rookie cop, and Takashi Shimura, as the seasoned detective who keeps him on the right side of the law, STRAY DOG (NORA INU) goes beyond a crime thriller, probing the squalid world of postwar Japan and the nature of the criminal mind."
"On the margins of a crumbling, perpetually rain-soaked Taipei, a single father (Lee Kang-sheng) makes his meager living holding up an advertising placard on a traffic island in the middle of a busy highway. His children, meanwhile, wait out their days in supermarkets, living off samples of free food. And then one day, a mysterious woman enters their lives. There are real stray dogs to be fed in Tsai’s everyday apocalypse, but the title also refers to its principal characters, living the cruelest of existences on the ragged edges of the modern world. STRAY DOGS is many things at once: minimal in its narrative content and syntax, as visually powerful as it is emotionally overwhelming, and bracingly pure in both its anger and its compassion."
"The Quays’ masterpiece, STREET OF CROCODILES is adapted from a short story by Polish writer Bruno Schulz, and was their first film shot on 35 mm. A museum keeper spits into the eyepiece of an ancient peep show and sets the musty machine in motion, plunging the viewer into a nightmarish netherworld of bizarre puppet rituals among the dirt and grime."
"Nagisa Oshima's first feature film, A STREET OF LOVE AND HOPE paints a biting portrait of poverty and class difference through the life of a young boy who sells pigeons on the street. The radical and unflinching politics that would become Oshima's hallmark are here on display in his earliest work."
"For his final film, Mizoguchi brought a lifetime of experience to bear on the heartbreaking tale of a brothel full of women whose dreams are constantly being shattered by the socioeconomic realities surrounding them. Set in Tokyo's Red Light District (the literal translation of the Japanese title), Street of Shame was so cutting, and its popularity so great, that when an antiprostitution law was passed in Japan just a few months after the film's release, some said it was a catalyst."
"Seattle, 1983. Taking their camera to the streets of what was supposedly America’s most livable city, filmmaker Martin Bell, photographer Mary Ellen Mark, and journalist Cheryl McCall set out to tell the stories of those society had left behind: homeless and runaway teenagers living on the city’s margins. Born from a “Life” magazine exposé by Mark and McCall, “Streetwise” follows an unforgettable group of at-risk children—including iron-willed fourteen-year-old Tiny, who would become the project’s most haunting and enduring face, along with the pugnacious yet resourceful Rat and the affable drifter DeWayne—who, driven from their broken homes, survive by hustling, panhandling, and dumpster diving. Granted remarkable access to their world, the filmmakers craft a devastatingly frank, nonjudgmental portrait of lost youth growing up far too soon in a world that has failed them."
"Mikio Naruse's final silent film is a gloriously rich portrait of a waitress, Sugiko, whose life, despite a host of male admirers and even some intrigued movie talent scouts, ends up taking a suffocatingly domestic turn after a wealthy businessman accidentally hits her with his car. Featuring vividly drawn characters and bold political commentary, STREET WITHOUT END is the grandly entertaining silent melodrama with which Naruse arrived at the brink of the sound era."
"Sergei Eisenstein's feature film debut, 'Strike' details the violent uprising in 1903 by factory workers in pre-Revolutionary Russia. Known widely as one of the founding films of soviet realism and the montage techniques Eisenstein would become famous for in his subsequent film, 'Battleship Potemkin'."
"The first collaboration between Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman is a devastating portrait of a woman’s existential crisis, set against the beautiful and forbidding backdrop of a volcanic island. After World War II, a Lithuanian refugee (Bergman) marries a simple Italian fisherman (Mario Vitale) she meets in a prisoner of war camp and accompanies him back to his isolated village on an island off the coast of Sicily. Cut off from the world, she finds herself crumbling emotionally, but she is destined for a dramatic epiphany. Balancing the director’s trademark neorealism—exemplified here in a remarkable depiction of the fishermen’s lives and work—with deeply felt melodrama, STROMBOLI is a revelation."
"On assignment for the mathematics department of le Palais de la Découverte, Jean Painlevé shot this film to be presented at the Paris museum’s 1937 international exhibition. THE STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL explores population rise and decline."
"Pierre Etaix’s first feature introduces the droll humor and oddball charm of its unique writer-director-star. As a tribute to Buster Keaton, Etaix fashioned this lovable story of a privileged yet sheltered young man (played by Etaix himself, in a nearly silent performance) who, under pressure from his parents, sets out to find a young woman to marry—though he has a hard time tearing his mind away from the famous singer whose face decorates the walls of his bedroom."
"Tired of churning out lightweight comedies, Hollywood director John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea) decides to make O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?—a serious, socially responsible film about human suffering. After his producers point out that he knows nothing of hardship, Sullivan hits the road disguised as a hobo. En route to enlightenment, he encounters a lovely but no-nonsense young woman (Veronica Lake)—and more trouble than he ever dreamed of. This comic masterpiece by Preston Sturges is among the finest Hollywood satires and a high-water mark in the career of one of the industry’s most revered funnymen."
"Universally acclaimed by critics, the multiple award-winning SUMMER HOURS is the great contemporary French filmmaker Olivier Assayas’s most personal film to date. Three siblings, played by Juliette Binoche, Charles Berling, and Jérémie Rénier, must decide what to do with the country estate and objects they’ve inherited from their mother. From this simple story, Assayas creates an exquisitely nuanced drama about the material of globalized modern living. Naturalistic and unsentimental, SUMMER HOURS is that rare film that pays respect to family by treating it with honesty."
"Touching on many of the themes that would define the rest of his career—isolation, performance, the inescapability of the past— Ingmar Bergman’s tenth film was a gentle drift toward true mastery. Maj-Britt Nilsson beguiles as an accomplished ballet dancer haunted by her tragic youthful affair with a shy, handsome student (Birger Malmsten). Her memories of the sunny, rocky shores of Stockholm’s outer archipelago mingle with scenes from her gloomy present at the theater where she performs. A film that the director considered a creative turning point, SUMMER INTERLUDE is a reverie about life and death that unites Bergman’s love of theater and cinema."
An American spinster’s dream of romance finally becomes a bittersweet reality when she meets a handsome—but married—Italian man while vacationing in Venice. Katharine Hepburn’s sensitive portrayal of the lonely heroine and Jack Hildyard’s glorious Technicolor photography make SUMMERTIME an endearing and visually enchanting film.
"Inspired by the earthy eroticism of Harriet Andersson, in the first of her many roles for him, Ingmar Bergman had a major international breakthrough with this sensual and ultimately ravaging tale of young love. A girl (Andersson) and boy (Lars Ekborg) from working-class families in Stockholm run away from home to spend a secluded, romantic summer at the beach, far from parents and responsibilities. Inevitably, it is not long before the pair are forced to return to reality. The version initially released in the U.S. was reedited by its distributor into something more salacious, but the original SUMMER WITH MONIKA (SOMMAREN MED MONIKA), presented here, is a work of stunning maturity and one of Bergman’s most important films."
"Chris Marker's documentary on Peking offers his thoughts on the people, culture and history of the city."
"One of the first films to draw international attention to the Australian New Wave, the debut feature from director Ken Hannam is a vivid look at the experiences of men working on a sheep station in the outback during the 1950s. In one of his first major roles, Australian-cinema icon Jack Thompson stars as a hard-drinking professional sheep shearer who leads his fellow workers in a strike after the wealthy landowners attempt to drive them off their territory. With its affectionate portrait of male camaraderie and message of worker solidarity, SUNDAY TOO FAR AWAY is one of the finest gems of the Australian New Wave."
"Written and directed by Amy Seimetz, this tantalizingly enigmatic, sun-kissed noir follows Crystal (Kate Lyn Sheil) and her boyfriend Leo (Kentucker Audley) on a tense and mysterious road trip through the desolate yet hauntingly beautiful landscape of central Florida. From the outset, the purpose of their journey is unclear, but as the couple travels up the Gulf Coast past an endless panorama of mangrove fields, trailer parks, and cookie-cutter housing developments, the disturbing details begin to emerge, revealing Crystal’s sinister past and the pair’s troubling future. Filmed on location in the environs of Seimetz’s hometown of St. Petersburg, SUN DON’T SHINE is a simmering work of pulp poetry driven by its powerful performances and eerily evocative setting."
"A farm hand is in love with his neighbor, but a city slicker might ruin his chances. Directed by Charlie Chaplin."
Young gangsters commit crimes and double crosses to fulfill their shady ambitions in the streets of Osaka.
"In the land of Superbia strict rules devide the societies of women and men, maintained also physically by the Milk River originating from the Cow God. Different customs and manners estrange the sexes far apart, the strong and sturdy women on one side and the decent and delicate men on the other. The story follows three main characters. A man and a woman find their ways to each other against all odds. Their actions become the catalyst of change within the societies, sparking a cultural revolution. The third and most conflicted character is a nemesis female character who does not want or does not know how to adapt to a coming, unknown new era."
"In this vibrant comedy, a failing supermarket manager hires an energetic woman to help him compete with a rival business. Directed by Juzo Itami."
"Ten years after making his mark on Spanish cinema with THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE, Víctor Erice returned to filmmaking with this adaptation of a novella by Adelaida García Morales, which deepens the director’s fascination with childhood, fantasy, and the legacy of his country’s civil war. In the North of Spain, Estrella grows up captivated by her father, a doctor with mystical powers—and by the enigma of his youth in the South, a near-mythical region whose secrets haunt Estrella more and more as time goes on. Though Erice’s original vision also encompassed a section set in the South itself, scenes that were never shot, EL SUR remains an experience of rare perfection and satisfaction, drawing on painterly cinematography by José Luis Alcaine to evoke the enchantments of memory and the inaccessible, inescapable mysteries of the past."
"A film in three parts: a man talking while a telephone rings, a walking tour of New York, and a goldfish swimming."
"Bertrand bides his time in a casually hostile and envious friendship with Guillaume. But when Guillaume seems to be making a play for the spirited, independent Suzanne, Bertrand watches disapprovingly. With its ragged black-and-white 16 mm photography and strong sense of 1960s Paris, SUZANNE’S CAREER, the second of Eric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales, is a wonderfully evocative portrait of youthful naivete and the complicated bonds of friendship and romance."
"One of the many films that Camille Billops and James Hatch made centering on Billops’s family, SUZANNE, SUZANNE presents a devastating portrait of the artist’s niece, haunted by the abuse she suffered as a child and the passivity of the family members who allowed it to continue."
"What if the ideal life you've meticulously constructed isn’t enough? Your swallowed truths, buried longings, become a parasite that lives off you, in you, with you. It’s a nagging reminder of the unrequited; a codependent affair. This breaking point is the film SWALLOWED. Sam, newly a mother, shops at a supermarket with her baby and husband Carlson. She throws a neighborhood shishkabob party in her den. Her family shares a Sunday breakfast. But through her smiles and picturesque tasks, there's a suppression. Sam’s grown something she can no longer contain. As she purges this parasite, we move inside her body and experience this wildness as a feverish dance.The parasite ejects us back into the kitchen of another woman, alone eating breakfast as she looks at a happy couple pictured on the back of her cereal box. It’s Sam and Carlson. What's beneath a picture? A dream within a dream. Horror meets dance, SWALLOWED suggests a complex truth to motherhood and domesticity."
"Volker Schlöndorff’s sumptuous adaptation of the first volume of Marcel Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time” stars Jeremy Irons as the appropriately named Charles Swann, a beautiful bachelor, majestic in manner, but prone to foul displays of emotion. He swims in the best circles of 1890s Paris, until a destructive love for a seductive courtesan named Odette (Ornella Muti) leads him astray. "
"The Swedenhielm family looks like a million bucks, but all that glitters is not gold. The illusion of wealth disguises financial ruin. Nearing bankruptcy, they hope a Nobel Prize will return the patriarch to prominence."
"Winner of the Grand Prix at Cannes, Atom Egoyan’s masterful adaptation of a novel by Russell Banks traces the aftermath of a school bus accident in a small Canadian town that leaves fourteen children dead. When Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), a big-city lawyer, arrives to organize a class-action lawsuit, his presence stirs up tensions within the town. Garnering Academy Award nominations for Egoyan for both best director and adapted screenplay, THE SWEET HEREAFTER is a powerful, deeply empathetic exploration of what it means to go on living in the face of tragedy."
"Though she went on to create a string of brilliant films, Jane Campion will always be remembered for her stunning debut feature SWEETIE, which focuses on the hazardous relationship between the buttoned-down, superstitious Kay and her rampaging, devil-may-care sister, Sweetie, and on their family’s profoundly rotten roots. A feast of colorful photography and captivating, idiosyncratic characters, the tough and tender SWEETIE heralded the emergence of this gifted director, as well as a renaissance of Australian cinema, which would take the film world by storm in the nineties."
"Tatsuya Nakadai and Toshiro Mifune star in the story of a wandering samurai who exists in a maelstrom of violence. A gifted swordsman plying his craft during the turbulent final days of shogunate rule in Japan, Ryunosuke (Nakadai) kills without remorse or mercy. It is a way of life that ultimately leads to madness. Kihachi Okamoto’s swordplay classic is the thrilling tale of a man who chooses to devote his life to evil."
"Legendary swordplay filmmaker Hideo Gosha’s SWORD OF THE BEAST chronicles the flight of the low-level swordsman Gennosuke, who kills one of his ministers as part of a reform plot. His former comrades then turn on him, and this betrayal so shakes his sense of honor that he decides to live in the wild, like an animal. There he joins up with a motley group who are illegally mining the shogun’s gold, and, with the aid of another swordsman, gets a chance not just at survival but to recover his name and honor."
The impassioned rhythms of Francisco Aguabella’s conga propel this portrait of the great Afro-Cuban percussionist.
"Bud Greenspan's film on the Games of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney profiles Cathy Freeman, who surged to glory before her home crowd in the 400 meters, as well as Leontien van Moorsel, the Dutch cyclist who had suffered from anorexia and won the gold medal in both the women's cycling individual road race and individual time trial."
"With this film, conceived during the occupation and released after the war, Claude Autant-Lara entered the realm of pure fantasy. Odette Joyeux stars as Sylvie, in love with a figure from the lore of her family's castle. Sylvie's father hires three actors to impersonate the ghost of her beloved, while the spirit himself (Jacques Tati, in his first feature-film role) stalks the grounds. Marrying a playful script, artful special effects, and wistful performances, Sylvie et le fantôme stages a delicate dance of enchantment."
"In his one-of-a-kind fiction/documentary hybrid SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM TAKE ONE, director William Greaves presides over a beleaguered film crew in New York’s Central Park, leaving them to try to figure out what kind of movie they’re making. A couple enacts a break-up scenario over and over, a documentary crew films a crew filming the crew, locals wander casually into the frame: the project defies easy description. Yet this wildly innovative sixties counterculture landmark remains one of the most tightly focused and insightful movies ever made about making movies."
"THE SYMBOL OF THE UNCONQUERED is a response, of sorts, to D. W. Griffith’s THE BIRTH OF A NATION. In Oscar Micheaux’s rendition, the Klan (here renamed the Knights of the Black Cross) is depicted as a gang of common thieves using violence and intimidation to steal a prospector’s valuable property."
"A rising nineteen-year-old singer by the name of Billie Holiday made her screen debut in this musical landmark, which features Duke Ellington and his orchestra performing his symphonic jazz piece “A Rhapsody of Negro Life” set to scenes of everyday African American life."
"Winner of the top prize at the Berlin Film Festival, this audacious, deliriously unhinged dark comedy from Israeli director Nadav Lapid evokes the whiplash disorientation of the immigrant experience with both ferocious intensity and unexpected poetry. Newcomer Tom Mercier delivers a whirlwind performance of almost feral unpredictability as Yoav, a disaffected young Israeli who flees Tel Aviv for Paris to start a new life. Desperate to integrate into his new society, Yoav sees becoming French as his only hope for salvation. But his attempts to erase his former identity soon awaken past demons and open up a bewildering existential abyss."
"Miguel Gomes spins a sumptuous, inventively eccentric two-part tale of love in the time of colonialism. We first meet Aurora as a cantankerous elderly woman in present-day Lisbon who, when she is hospitalized, asks that word of her grave condition be passed on to a man whom no one has ever heard her speak of before. It’s this curious wish that whisks us away to Africa fifty years earlier, before the start of the Portuguese Colonial War, when Aurora, then the smoldering wife of a wealthy young farmer, became involved in a forbidden love affair with her husband’s best friend. Their doomed romance unfolds as an intoxicating, playfully postmodern melodrama set against a lush tropical backdrop and scored to a soundtrack of Phil Spector singles."
"Just as the film industry was converting to sound, two of the silent era’s most visionary artists fled to the South Seas to collaborate on a work of pure visual beauty untainted by Hollywood’s latest technical obsession. F. W. Murnau was a supreme stylist who had crafted dreamlike fables both in Germany (FAUST) and Hollywood (SUNRISE). Robert Flaherty was a groundbreaking documentarian whose NANOOK OF THE NORTH and MOANA defined the nascent ethnographic film movement. Over the course of nine months, they immersed themselves in Tahitian culture. Drawing inspiration from the topography and people of the surrounding islands, they (with Murnau at the helm) fashioned an emotionally rich story of the flowering romance between a young man and woman, as the shadow of colonialism begins to fall upon their island paradise."
"Edward Yang’s second feature is a mournful anatomy of a city caught between the past and the present. Made in collaboration with Yang's fellow New Taiwan Cinema master Hou Hsiao-hsien, TAIPEI STORY chronicles the growing estrangement between a washed-up baseball player (Hou, in a rare on-screen performance) working in his family’s textile business and his girlfriend (Tsai Chin), who clings to the upward mobility of her career in property development. As the couple's dreams of marriage and emigration begin to unravel, Yang’s gaze illuminates the precariousness of domestic life and the desperation of Taiwan’s globalized modernity."
"In this one-reel film from 1918, Harold Lloyd stars as a man looking to spend his last 25 cents."
"At the beginning of Seijun Suzuki's taut and twisty whodunit, a prison truck is attacked and a convict inside murdered. The penitentiary guard on duty, Daijiro (Michitaro Mizushima), is accused of negligence and suspended, only to take it upon himself to track down the killers."
"Filmmaking legend Roberto Rossellini brings his passion for realism and unerring eye for the everyday to this portrait of the early years of the reign of France’s “Sun King,” and in the process reinvents the costume drama. The death of chief minister Cardinal Mazarin, the construction of the palace at Versailles, the extravagant meals of the royal court: all are recounted with the same meticulous quotidian detail that Rossellini brought to his contemporary portraits of postwar Italy. THE TAKING OF POWER BY LOUIS XIV dares to place a larger-than-life figure at the level of mere mortal."
"ZATOICHI #1
"
Nobuko Miyamoto stars as a geisha who brings good luck to the men she sleeps with.
"Krzysztof Kieślowski made more than twenty documentaries, including the following short. In TALKING HEADS, Kieślowski poses the questions “What year were you born?” “Who are you?” and “What do you most wish for?” to forty different people, ranging from an infant to a one-hundred-year-old woman."
"The tale of an eccentric band of culinary ronin who guide the widow of a noodle-shop owner on her quest for the perfect recipe, this rapturous “ramen western” by Japanese director Juzo Itami is an entertaining, genre-bending adventure underpinned by a deft satire of the way social conventions distort the most natural of human urges, our appetites. Interspersing the efforts of Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto) and friends to make her café a success with the erotic exploits of a gastronome gangster and glimpses of food culture both high and low, the sweet, sexy, and surreal TAMPOPO is a lavishly inclusive paean to the sensual joys of nourishment, and one of the most mouthwatering examples of food on film ever made."
"In 1988, renegade filmmaker Robert Altman and Pulitzer Prize–winning Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau created a presidential candidate, ran him alongside the other hopefuls during the primary season, and presented their media campaign as a cross between a soap opera and TV news. The result was the groundbreaking TANNER ’88, a piercing satire of media-age American politics, in which actors Michael Murphy (as contender Jack Tanner) and Cynthia Nixon (as his daughter) rub elbows on the campaign trail with real-life political players Jesse Jackson, Gary Hart, Bob Dole, Ralph Nader, Kitty Dukakis, and Gloria Steinem, among many others."
"Jean Vigo's inventive short portrait of Jean Taris, a swimming champion."
"A pioneering, ahead-of-its-time work in the development of the autobiographical documentary, Jonathan Caouette’s cathartic film diary swirls together Super 8 and VHS home movies, answering machine messages, family photographs, and other records of a lifetime. It tells the story of Caouette’s tumultuous childhood, his coming out as gay, and his complex relationship with his schizophrenic mother, a former beauty queen whose life was derailed by the electroshock treatments she received in her youth. Famously made for just $218 and edited using free iMovie software, TARNATION went on to become a critical sensation that redefined the boundaries of personal filmmaking."
Isabelle Adjani narrates an architectural tribute to the Cinémathèque française on its fiftieth anniversary.
"The first Iranian film to win the Palme d’Or, this austere, emotionally complex drama by the great Abbas Kiarostami follows the middle-aged Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) as he drives around the hilly outskirts of Tehran looking for someone who will agree to dispose of his body after he commits suicide, a taboo under Islam. Extended conversations with three passengers (a soldier, a seminarian, and a taxidermist) elicit different views of mortality and individual choice. Operating at once as a closely observed, realistic story and a fable populated by archetypal figures, TASTE OF CHERRY challenges the viewer to consider what often goes unexamined in everyday life."
"The revolutionary British New Wave films of the early 1960s were celebrated for their uncompromising depictions of working-class lives and relations between the sexes. Directed by Tony Richardson, a leading light of that movement, and based on one of the most controversial plays of its time, A TASTE OF HONEY stars Rita Tushingham, in a star-making debut role, as a disaffected teenager finding her way amid the economic desperation of industrial Manchester, and despite an absent, self-absorbed mother. With its unapologetic identification with social outcasts and its sensitive, modern approach to matters of sexuality and race, Richardson's classic is a still startling benchmark work of realism."
"First love is often hot and heavy, but short-lived. A woman endures the hardships of an abusive husband for too long, and when an old lover returns she begins to fan that flame. As things heat up between these childhood sweethearts, her family expresses their disapproval. Energized by the warmth of her former beau she considers setting her current relationship ablaze."
"Internationally acclaimed director Jafar Panahi drives a yellow cab through the vibrant streets of Tehran, picking up a diverse (and yet representative) group of passengers in a single day. Each man, woman, and child candidly expresses his or her own view of the world, while being interviewed by the curious and gracious driver-director. His camera, placed on the dashboard of his mobile film studio, captures a spirited slice of Iranian society while also brilliantly redefining the borders of comedy, drama, and cinema."
A fierce and dedicated tax collector ruthlessly pursues a hood operating adult motels and crooked real estate deals.
Ryôko Itakura returns as the tough-as-nails government taxing agent. This time she must figure out a way to expose a fanatical religious cult lead by a corrupt sociopath.
"This lyrical, richly impressionistic documentary follows three adolescent brothers as they journey through one night in New Orleans, encountering a wondrous kaleidoscope of dancers, musicians, hustlers, and revelers parading through the lamplit streets. A whirlwind, full-sensory immersion into the New Orleans night world, TCHOUPITOULAS passes through an array of lively and luminous locales as it introduces viewers to the unique personalities who give the city its legendary vibrancy."
"Things of worth are often neglected in favour of that which might be more immediately gratifying. Unfortunately, the things that are neglected are often lost forever, irreplaceable. This is the story of a man with a misguided and intense focus - one which started in his youth and carried on to old age. His life events are chronicled through the loss of his teeth - and how his obsessive efforts to amend what was damaged bring on yet further destruction."
"In his autobiography, director Roman Polanski writes that the theme of TEETH SMILE was set for him by a supervisor at film school. The film follows a peeping tom as he looks through a bathroom window."
FANTASTIC PLANET was not the first collaboration between writer-director René Laloux and illustrator Roland Topor. Presented here is a short film they made together in the mid-1960s: LES TEMPS MORTS.
"Resisting the stagebound atmosphere of THE EXILE, Oscar Micheaux found ways to shoot a talking picture on location, without cumbersome and expensive audio recording equipment. He did this by making one of his characters deaf (rendering speech unnecessary) and having much of the dialogue spoken off-camera (so it could be dubbed later). These devices are clumsily executed at times, but they prove that Micheaux had a more canny understanding of the medium than he is often given credit for."
"Based on the hugely popular 1854 temperance novel by Timothy Shay Arthur (and William W. Pratt’s 1858 stage adaptation), Roy Calnek’s TEN NIGHTS IN A BAR ROOM boasts a masterful performance by Charles Sidney Gilpin as a father whose life and family are devastated by his alcoholism."
"One of the iconoclastic Pier Paolo Pasolini’s most radical provocations finds the auteur moving beyond the poetic, proletarian earthiness that first won him renown and notoriety with a coolly cryptic exploration of bourgeois spiritual emptiness. Terence Stamp stars as the mysterious stranger—perhaps an angel, perhaps a devil—who, one by one, seduces the members of a wealthy Milanese family (including European cinema icons Silvana Mangano, Massimo Girotti, Laura Betti, and Anne Wiazemsky), precipitating an existential crisis in each of their lives. Unfolding nearly wordlessly in a procession of sacred and profane images, this tantalizing metaphysical riddle—blocked from exhibition by the Catholic Church for degeneracy—is at once a blistering Marxist treatise on sex, religion, and art and a primal scream into the void."
"In Godzilla’s last gasp of the Showa era, aliens retrieve Mechagodzilla’s remains and rebuild it with the aid of an unhinged biologist (a scenery-chewing Akihiko Hirata), in hopes of defeating Godzilla for possession of planet Earth. This film marked the return of director Ishiro Honda, who had retired years earlier, disheartened by the increasingly kid-friendly approach of the series. For this final entry, Honda steers the King of the Monsters back into grim territory, interweaving an alien-invasion plot with a tale of tragic romance."
"Locked away in an asylum for a decade and teetering between life and death, the criminal mastermind Doctor Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) has scribbled his last will and testament: a manifesto establishing a future empire of crime. When the document’s nefarious writings start leading to terrifying parallels in reality, it’s up to Berlin’s star detective, Inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke, reprising his role from M) to connect the most fragmented, maddening clues in a case unlike any other. A sequel to his enormously successful silent film DR. MABUSE: THE GAMBLER, Fritz Lang’s THE TESTAMENT OF DR. MABUSE reunites the director with the character that had effectively launched his career. Lang put slogans and ideas expounded by the Nazis into the mouth of a madman, warning his audience of an imminent menace, which was soon to become a reality. Nazi Minister of Information Joseph Goebbels saw the film as an instruction manual for terrorist action against the government and banned it for “endangering public order and security.” A landmark of mystery and suspense for countless espionage and noir thrillers to come, this is the complete, uncut original director’s version in a stunning new transfer."
"In 1969, Stuart Cooper made this short film about the work of Spanish artist Juan Genovés, whose paintings depict the horror of oppression and brutality. It won prizes at the Berlin, Moscow, and Venice film festivals. It also caught the attention of James Quinn of the Imperial War Museum, which ultimately led to Cooper’s directing OVERLORD."
"This meticulously crafted adaptation stars Harry Baur as novelist Georges Simenon's indelible creation Inspector Maigret, investigating the odd circumstances surrounding the killing of a wealthy American woman in Paris. Every bit Baur's equal is the Russian émigré actor Valeéry Inkijinoff, cast as a reptilian, nihilistic medical student. Julien Duvivier gives the viewer one evocative image after another, constructing a work of sinister beauty."
"A lost-and-found revelation from indie film and TV maverick Jan Oxenberg is a docu-fantasy narrative focused on the filmmaker’s hilarious, messy, Jewish family as they prepare to say goodbye to someone they love. Narrated by a cardboard cutout of Oxenberg’s scowling child self, THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT takes us on a journey through the proceedings, attempting to defeat death and never say goodbye. An early Sundance hit but virtually unseen for decades, the film reemerges as a singular, uncategorizable exploration of the meaning of life, death, and the tangled stuff that is a family. In this poignant, hilarious, and complex reflection on letting go, Oxenberg innovatively transforms personal tragedy into universally resonant art that is now claiming its rightful place as a classic of independent cinema."
"One of cinema’s most dashing duos, real-life spouses Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier live their greatest on-screen romance in this visually dazzling tragic love story from legendary producer-director Alexander Korda. Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars of the late eighteenth century, THAT HAMILTON WOMAN is a gripping account of the scandalous adulterous affair between the British Royal Navy officer Lord Horatio Nelson and the renowned beauty Emma, Lady Hamilton, the wife of a British ambassador. With its grandly designed sea battles and formidable star performances, THAT HAMILTON WOMAN (Winston Churchill’s favorite movie, which he claimed to have seen over eighty times) brings history to vivid, glamorous life."
"In noirish darkness, a man commits a shocking robbery. But, as we soon learn, this seeming criminal mastermind is actually a sensitive everyman driven to desperation by the need to provide for his family. Unfolding over the course of one night, Yasujiro Ozu's That Night's Wife combines suspense with the emotional domestic drama one associates with the filmmaker's later masterpieces, and employs beautifully evocative camera work."
"Yasujiro Ozu’s frequent leading man Chishu Ryu is riveting as Shuhei, a widowed high school teacher who finds that the more he tries to do what is best for his son’s future, the more they are separated. Though primarily a delicately wrought story of parental love, THERE WAS A FATHER offers themes of sacrifice that were deemed appropriately patriotic by Japanese censors at the time of its release during World War II, making it a uniquely political film in Ozu’s body of work."
The music video for 'These Boots' by the Leningrad Cowboys.
"Even early on in his directing career, Masaki Kobayashi didn't shy away from controversy. Among the first Japanese films to deal directly with the scars of World War II, this drama about a group of rank-and-file Japanese soldiers jailed for crimes against humanity was adapted from the diaries of real prisoners. Because of its potentially inflammatory content, the film was shelved by the studio for three years before being released."
"Legendary producer Alexander Korda’s marvel THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, inspired by “The Arabian Nights,” is one of the most spectacular fantasy films ever made, an eye-popping effects pioneer brimming with imagination and technical wizardry. When Prince Ahmad (John Justin) is blinded and cast out of Bagdad by the nefarious Jaffar (Conrad Veidt), he joins forces with the scrappy thief Abu (the incomparable Sabu, in his definitive role) to win back his royal place, as well as the heart of a beautiful princess (June Duprez). With its luscious Technicolor, vivid sets, and unprecedented visual wonders, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD has charmed viewers of all ages for decades."
"Among the most important documentaries ever made, THE THIN BLUE LINE, by Errol Morris, erases the border between art and activism. A work of meticulous journalism and gripping drama, it recounts the disturbing tale of Randall Dale Adams, a drifter who was charged with the murder of a Dallas police officer and sent to death row, despite evidence that he did not commit the crime. Incorporating stylized reenactments, penetrating interviews, and haunting original music by Philip Glass, Morris uses cinema to build a case forensically while effortlessly entertaining his viewers. THE THIN BLUE LINE effected real-world change, proving film’s power beyond the shadow of a doubt."
"A landmark collaboration between writer H. G. Wells, producer Alexander Korda, and designer and director William Cameron Menzies, THINGS TO COME is a science fiction film like no other, a prescient political work that predicts a century of turmoil and progress. Skipping through time, THINGS TO COME bears witness to world war, disease, dictatorship, and, finally, utopia. Conceived, written, and overseen by Wells himself as an adaptation of his own work, this megabudget production, the most ambitious ever from Korda’s London Films, is a triumph of imagination and technical audacity."
"What happens when the life you’ve worked so hard to build falls apart all at once? Nathalie (a radiant Isabelle Huppert) is a philosophy teacher with a seemingly settled existence, juggling a rich life of the mind with the day-to-day demands of career and family (including frequent visits to her drama-queen mother, played by the legendary Édith Scob). But beginning with the bombshell revelation that her husband of twenty-five years is leaving her, the pillars of Nathalie’s life start to crumble, leaving her adrift but with a newfound sense of liberation. Winner of the best director award at the Berlin Film Festival, Mia Hansen-Løve’s acutely perceptive tale of middle-age upheaval is a deeply intelligent, soul-searching look at what it means to create a life of one’s own."
"Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s follow-up to his international breakthrough THE MARRIAGE OF MARIA BRAUN is a wildly anarchic satire of guerrilla terrorism in which a band of leftist radicals inadvertently become puppets of the West German government, which uses them to justify its authoritarian policies. Taking aim at the entire spectrum of political ideologies, THE THIRD GENERATION stands as one of Fassbinder’s most provocative and explosively controversial explorations of power and control."
"Despite its setting in 1567 Japan, Umetsugu Inoue's 1963 drama THE THIRD SHADOW WARRIOR (aka The Third Shadow, aka Daisan no Kagemusha) seemed to have a lot to say about twentieth century Japan -- derived from a novel by leftist author Norio Nanjo, its story of a peasant who ascends to the nobility, only to be destroyed in the process, is a harsh criticism of social caste systems and their toll on the people trapped within them"
"A couple traveling across a war-ravaged Europe. A disintegrating marriage. A ballet dancer's scarred past. Her friend's psychological agony. Elliptically told in flashbacks and multiple narrative threads, Ingmar Bergman's THIRST shows people enslaved to memory and united in isolation."
"Koreyoshi Kurahara adapted a novel by Yukio Mishima for Thirst for Love (Ai no kawaki), a tense psychological drama about a young woman who is widowed after marrying into a wealthy family, and becomes sexually involved with her father-in-law, while harboring a destructive obsession with the family gardener. Kurahara's atmospheric style is a perfect match for Mishima's brooding sensuality."
"David Lean brings to vivid emotional life Noël Coward’s epic chronicle of a working-class family in the London suburbs over the course of two decades. Robert Newton and Celia Johnson are surpassingly affecting as Frank and Ethel Gibbons, a couple with three children whose modest household is touched by joy and tragedy from the tail end of the First World War to the beginning of the Second. With its mix of politics and melodrama, THIS HAPPY BREED is a quintessential British domestic drama, featuring subtly expressive Technicolor cinematography by Ronald Neame and a remarkable supporting cast including John Mills, Stanley Holloway, and Kay Walsh."
"The first work fearless auteur Jafar Panahi made after being officially banned from filmmaking by the Iranian government, this clandestine documentary—shot partially on an iPhone and smuggled into France in a cake for a last-minute submission to Cannes—depicts the day-to-day life of the acclaimed director during his house arrest in his Tehran apartment. While appealing his sentence, Panahi is seen talking to his family and lawyer on the phone, discussing his plight with codirector Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, and reflecting on the meaning of the art of filmmaking. What emerges from this intimate self-portrait is a by turns humorous, moving, and defiant statement of creative resilience in the face of oppression."
"One of the finest British films ever made, this benchmark of kitchen-sink realism follows the self-defeating professional and romantic pursuits of a miner turned rugby player eking out an existence in drab Yorkshire. With an astonishing, raging performance by a young Richard Harris, an equally blistering turn by fellow Oscar nominee Rachel Roberts as the widow with whom he lodges, and electrifying direction by Lindsay Anderson, in his feature-film debut following years of documentary work, THIS SPORTING LIFE remains a dramatic powerhouse."
"A tricycle-riding harlequin lays a trap in this disquieting, psychosexual take on a story from the epic Babylonian poem."
The music video for 'Those Were the Days' by the Leningrad Cowboys.
"Forty years after her uncle Djibril Diop Mambéty's landmark of Senegalese cinema TOUKI BOUKI, Mati Diop revisits its lead actor, Magaye Niang, to explore the legacy of a film that continues to loom large."
"In the first case, a museum worker crosses into the world within a painting. In the second case, two friends become suspects in the murder of the woman they both love. In the third case, one man uses the dreams of another in his plot for revenge."
"In the devastating first film of the Three Colors trilogy, Juliette Binoche gives a tour de force performance as Julie, a woman reeling from the tragic death of her husband and young daughter. But BLUE is more than just a blistering study of grief; it’s also a tale of liberation, as Julie attempts to free herself from the past while confronting truths about the life of her late husband, a composer. Shot in sapphire tones by Sławomir Idziak, and set to an extraordinary operatic score by Zbigniew Preisner, BLUE is an overwhelming sensory experience."
"Krzysztof Kieślowski closes his Three Colors trilogy in grand fashion, with an incandescent meditation on fate and chance, starring Irène Jacob as a sweet-souled yet somber runway model in Geneva whose life dramatically intersects with that of a bitter retired judge, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant. Meanwhile, just down the street, a seemingly unrelated story of jealousy and betrayal unfolds. RED is an intimate look at forged connections and a splendid final statement from a remarkable filmmaker at the height of his powers."
"The most playful and also the grittiest of Kieślowski’s Three Colors films follows the adventures of Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski), a Polish immigrant living in France. The hapless hairdresser opts to leave Paris for his native Warsaw when his wife (Julie Delpy) sues him for divorce (her reason: their marriage was never consummated) and then frames him for arson after setting her own salon ablaze. WHITE, which goes on to chronicle Karol Karol’s elaborate revenge plot, manages to be both a ticklish dark comedy about the economic inequalities of Eastern and Western Europe and a sublime reverie about twisted love."
"This anthology film by Satyajit Ray features three separate stories adapted from the works of Rabindranath Tagore. The first segment concerns a young man who grows bored with rural life, unaware that his housekeeper has grown attached to him. The second segment is a story within a story, a haunting fable told by a schoolteacher about the strange man he discovered inhabiting a nearby mansion. The last segment concerns a young man who rebels against his arranged marriage."
"Anna Biller casts herself as a melancholic Arabian ruler, a queen bee presiding over a cotton-candy pink hive, and a 1960s teenybopper princess in this retro-fantastic feminist anthem."
"Bette Davis, Joan Blondell, and Ann Dvorak star as three grammar school friends who remain close even as they grow into very different women in this pre-Code drama. Ten years after graduating, hardened Mary Keaton (Blondell) has spent time in prison and now works as a showgirl as she struggles for a shot at stardom; Ruth Wescott (Davis) holds down a job as a hardworking, level-headed secretary; and Vivian Revere Kirkwood (Ann Dvorak) has grown bored with motherhood and her marriage to a wealthy attorney. Now, when Vivian reveals that she is having an affair with would-be gangster Michael Loftus (Lyle Talbot), she accelerates a downward spiral into crime, cocaine, and kidnapping that can only end in tragedy."
"This first feature by the legendary Hideo Gosha is among the most beloved chanbara (sword-fighting) films. An origin-story offshoot of a Japanese television phenomenon of the same name, THREE OUTLAW SAMURAI is a classic in its own right. A wandering, seen-it-all ronin (Tetsuro Tamba) becomes entangled in the dangerous business of two other samurai (Isamu Nagato and Mikijiro Hira), hired to execute a band of peasants who have kidnapped the daughter of a corrupt magistrate. With remarkable storytelling economy and thrilling action scenes, this is an expertly mounted tale of revenge and loyalty."
"The sly melodies of composer Kurt Weill and the daring of dramatist Bertolt Brecht come together on-screen under the direction of German auteur G. W. Pabst (PANDORA’S BOX) in this classic adaptation of the Weimar-era theatrical sensation. Set in the impoverished back alleys of Victorian London, THE THREEPENNY OPERA follows underworld antihero Mackie Messer (a.k.a. Mack the Knife) as he tries to woo Polly Peachum and elude the authorities. With its palpable evocation of corruption and dread, set to Weill’s irresistible score, THE THREEPENNY OPERA remains a benchmark of early sound cinema. It is presented here in both its celebrated German and rare French versions."
"A trio of bumbling young men frolic at the beach. While they swim, their clothes are stolen and replaced with new outfits. Donning these, they are mistaken for undocumented Koreans and end up on the run from comically outraged authorities. A cutting commentary on Japan's treatment of its Korean immigrants, this is Nagisa Oshima at both his most politically engaged and madcap."
"A vivid, visceral “Macbeth” adaptation, THRONE OF BLOOD, directed by Akira Kurosawa, sets Shakespeare’s definitive tale of ambition and duplicity in a ghostly, fog-enshrouded landscape in feudal Japan. As a hardened warrior who rises savagely to power, Toshiro Mifune gives a remarkable, animalistic performance, as does Isuzu Yamada as his ruthless wife. THRONE OF BLOOD fuses classical Western tragedy with formal elements taken from Noh theater to create an unforgettable cinematic experience."
"While vacationing on a remote island retreat, a family finds its fragile ties tested when daughter Karin (an astonishing Harriet Andersson) discovers her father (Gunnar Björnstrand) has been using her schizophrenia for his own literary ends. As she drifts in and out of lucidity, Karin’s father, her husband (Max von Sydow), and her younger brother (Lars Passgård) are unable to prevent her descent into the abyss of mental illness. Winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY, the first work in Ingmar Bergman’s trilogy on faith and the loss of it, presents an unflinching vision of a family’s near disintegration and a tortured psyche further taunted by the intangibility of God’s presence."
"Abbas Kiarostami takes metanarrative gamesmanship to masterful new heights in the final installment of THE KOKER TRILOGY. Unfolding “behind the scenes” of AND LIFE GOES ON, this film traces the complications that arise when the romantic misfortune of one of the actors—a young man who pines for the woman cast as his wife, even though, in real life, she will have nothing to do with him—creates turmoil on set and leaves the hapless director caught in the middle. An ineffably lovely, gentle human comedy steeped in the folkways of Iranian village life, THROUGH THE OLIVE TREES peels away layer after layer of artifice as it investigates the elusive, alchemical relationship between cinema and reality."

A young wife loses patience with her career-minded husband and returns to her parents' home while an unpaid mortgage force the couple to rent their home for the summer. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"Following the death of his hoarder mother, a young man eagerly looks forward to cleaning out her junk-strewn home—but first he’ll have to contend with his sister, who is intent on preserving the house just as it is—in this tender look at grief and letting go."
"Pedro Almodóvar’s colorful and controversial tribute to the pleasures and perils of Stockholm syndrome, TIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN! is a rambunctious dark comedy starring Antonio Banderas as an unbalanced but alluring ex-mental-patient and Victoria Abril as the B-movie and former porn star he takes prisoner in the hopes of convincing her to marry him. A highly unconventional romance that came on the spike heels of Almodóvar’s international sensation WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, this is a splashy, sexy central work in the career of one of the world’s most beloved and provocative auteurs, radiantly shot by the director’s great cinematographer, José Luis Alcaine."
"Su Friedrich creates a dialogue between past and present, pairing her mother’s recollections of growing up in Germany during the rise and fall of Nazism with images of contemporary Germany and the artist’s current life in Chicago. The result is an essay film that reflects on Friedrich’s complicated relationship to her mother’s experience and her own radical political life."
"A detective attempts to solve a murder despite the false leads provided by a young girl, his only available witness."
"A true twentieth-century trailblazer, Harvey Milk was an outspoken human rights activist and one of the first openly gay U.S. politicians elected to public office; even after his assassination in 1978, he continues to inspire disenfranchised people around the world. The Oscar-winning THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK, directed by Robert Epstein and produced by Richard Schmiechen, was as groundbreaking as its subject. One of the first feature documentaries to address gay life in America, it’s a work of advocacy itself, bringing Milk’s message of hope and equality to a wider audience. This exhilarating trove of original documentary material and archival footage is as much a vivid portrait of a time and place (San Francisco’s historic Castro District in the seventies) as a testament to the legacy of a political visionary."
"Michael Redgrave plays the estranged, alcoholic father of a young man about to be executed for a murder he didn't commit, and he is just unsteady enough in his thinking to make every twist of this drama a source of ever-tightening suspense."
"Oskar is born in Germany in 1924 with an advanced intellect. Repulsed by the hypocrisy of adults and the irresponsibility of society, he refuses to grow older after his third birthday. While the chaotic world around him careens toward the madness and folly of World War II, Oskar pounds incessantly on his beloved tin drum and perfects his uncannily piercing shrieks. THE TIN DRUM, which earned the Palme d’Or at Cannes and the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, is Volker Schlöndorff’s visionary adaptation of Nobel laureate Günter Grass’ acclaimed novel, characterized by surreal imagery, arresting eroticism, and clear-eyed satire."
"Lena Dunham got her start making YouTube videos, but she emerged as a major talent thanks to the breakthrough success of this exceptionally sharp comedy, which garnered the twenty-four-year-old writer-director-actor comparisons to the likes of Woody Allen. Dunham plays Aura, a recent college graduate who returns to New York and moves back in with her mother and sister (played by the filmmaker’s real-life mother and sister). Though Aura is gripped by stasis and confusion about her future, Dunham locates endless sources of refreshing humor in her plight. As painfully confessional as it is amusing, TINY FURNITURE is an authentic, incisive portrait of a young woman at a crossroads."
"Thirty years in the making, TINY: THE LIFE OF ERIN BLACKWELL continues to follow one of the most indelible subjects of STREETWISE, a groundbreaking documentary on homeless and runaway teenagers. Erin Blackwell, a.k.a. Tiny, was introduced in filmmaker Martin Bell, photographer Mary Ellen Mark, and journalist Cheryl McCall's earlier film as a brash fourteen-year-old living precariously on the margins in Seattle. Now a forty-four year-old mother of ten, Blackwell reflects with Mark on the journey they’ve experienced together, from Blackwell’s struggles with addiction to her regrets to her dreams for her own children, even as she sees them being pulled down the same path of drugs and desperation. Interweaving three decades’ worth of Mark’s photographs and footage that includes previously unseen outtakes from STREETWISE, this is a heartrending, deeply empathetic portrait of a family struggling to break free of the cycle of trauma, as well as a summation of the life’s work of Mark, an irreplaceable artistic voice."
"As nervy as it is hilarious, this screwball masterpiece from Ernst Lubitsch stars Jack Benny and, in her final screen appearance, Carole Lombard as husband-and-wife thespians in Nazi-occupied Warsaw who become caught up in a dangerous spy plot. TO BE OR NOT TO BE is a Hollywood film of the boldest black humor, which went into production soon after the U.S. entered World War II. Lubitsch manages to brilliantly balance political satire, romance, slapstick, and urgent wartime suspense in a comic high-wire act that has never been equaled."
Federico Fellini’s loose adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe’s “Never Bet the Devil Your Head” stars Terence Stamp as an alcoholic actor who suffers from disturbing visions.
"An orchestra violinist's dreams of becoming a celebrated soloist and fears of his own mediocrity get in the way of his marriage to the patient, caring Marta. Played out to the music of Beethoven, Ingmar Bergman's To Joy is a heartbreaking tale of one man's inability to overcome the demons standing in the way of his happiness."
"Also known as THE GHOST OF YOTSUYA, this Nobuo Nakagawa film follows a samurai who betrays his wife, only to find her ghost has returned to reap her vengeance upon him."
"Combining three prevalent genres of the day, the student comedy, the salaryman film, and the domestic drama, Ozu created this warmhearted family comedy, and demonstrated that he was truly coming into his own as a cinema craftsman. The setup is simple: Low wage-earning dad Okajima is depending on his bonus, and so are his wife and children, yet payday doesn't exactly go as planned. Exquisite and economical, Ozu's film alternates between brilliantly mounted comic sequences and heartrending working-class realities."
"In this jazzy gangster film, reformed killer Tetsu’s attempt to go straight is thwarted when his former cohorts call him back to Tokyo to help battle a rival gang. Director Seijun Suzuki’s onslaught of stylized violence and trippy colors is equal parts Russ Meyer, Samuel Fuller, and Nagisa Oshima—an anything-goes, in-your-face rampage. TOKYO DRIFTER is a delirious highlight of the brilliantly excessive Japanese cinema of the sixties."
"On the streets of Tokyo and in meetings with some of Yasujiro Ozu's legendary collaborators, renowned director Wim Wenders explores the world of Ozu, whom Wenders considers 'a sacred treasure of cinema.'"
"A spectacle of magnificent proportions and remarkable intimacy, Kon Ichikawa’s TOKYO OLYMPIAD remains one of the greatest films ever made about sports. Supervising a vast team of technicians using scores of cameras, Ichikawa captured the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo in glorious widescreen images, using cutting-edge telephoto lenses and exquisite slow motion to create lyrical, idiosyncratic poetry from the athletic drama surging all around him. Drawn equally to the psychology of losers and winners—including the legendary Ethiopian marathoner Abebe Bikila, who receives the film’s most exalted tribute—Ichikawa captures the triumph, passion, and suffering of competition with a singular humanistic vision, and in doing so effected a transformative influence on the art of documentary filmmaking."
"A profoundly stirring evocation of elemental humanity and universal heartbreak, TOKYO STORY is the crowning achievement of the unparalleled Yasujiro Ozu. The film, which follows an aging couple’s journey to visit their grown children in bustling postwar Tokyo, surveys the rich and complex world of family life with the director’s customary delicacy and incisive perspective on social mores. Featuring lovely performances from Ozu regulars Chishu Ryu and Setsuko Hara, TOKYO STORY plumbs and deepens the director’s recurring theme of generational conflict, creating what is without question one of cinema’s mightiest masterpieces."
"One of Ozu's most piercing portraits of family strife, Tokyo Twilight follows the parallel paths of two sisters contending with an absent mother, unwanted pregnancy, and marital discord."
"TOMBOY tells the story of ten-year-old Laure (played by the amazing Zoé Héran) who moves to the suburbs and decides to pass as a boy among the pack of neighborhood kids. As “Mickäel” she catches the attention of leader of the pack, Lisa, who becomes smitten with her. Finding resourceful ways to hide her true self, Laure takes advantage of her new identity, as if the end of the summer would never reveal her unsettling secret. Writer-director Céline Sciamma brings a light and charming touch to this contemporary coming-of-age story, which deftly explores relationships between children and their peers and parents—and the even more complicated relationship between one’s heart and one’s body."
"In the early 1960s, at the height of the British New Wave, director Tony Richardson and playwright John Osborne set out for more fanciful territory than the gritty realism of the movement they’d helped establish. TOM JONES brings a theatrical flair to Henry Fielding’s canonical eighteenth-century novel, boisterously chronicling the misadventures of the foundling of the title (Albert Finney, in a career-defining performance), whose easy charm seems to lead him astray at every turn from his beloved, the wellborn Sophie Western (Susannah York). This spirited picaresque, evocatively shot in England’s rambling countryside and featuring an extraordinary ensemble cast, went on to become a worldwide sensation, winning the Oscar for best picture on the way to securing its status as a classic of irreverent wit and playful cinematic expression."
"This multi-lingual drama from Jean Renoir follows Toni, an Italian immigrant who gets entangled in many relationships after moving to the south of France."
"This exquisitely ethereal adaptation of a short story by Haruki Murakami brings the writer’s unique vision to the screen with the delicacy and subtle grace of a haiku. Growing up in postwar Japan, commercial illustrator Tony Takitani (Issey Ogata) has lived a life steadfastly devoted to his work and largely devoid of genuine human connection. When he begins a seemingly idyllic affair with the angelic Eiko (Rie Miyazawa), Takitani is launched on a haunting journey of love, loss, and emotional awakening."
"Dominga Sotomayor's intoxicating teenage daydream floats by in a haze of gorgeously gauzy images. Chile, 1990: in a remote artists' commune in the shadow of the Andes, a small band of families builds a new world far removed from the tumult of the city and the emerging freedoms that have come with the country's transition to democracy. It's in this time of change and reckoning that sixteen-year-old Sofia (Demian Hernández) confronts love, fear, and the dangerous unpredictability of nature. As the New Year approaches, Sofia begins to realize that you can't shut the real world out forever."
"One day, Tord accidentally walks in to the apartment next to his own. Another person named Tord lives there, he has just moved in."
"Ingmar Bergman's first produced screenplay was for the great Swedish filmmaker Alf Sjöberg's Torment, a dark coming-of-age drama about a boarding-school senior, Widgren, terrorized by his sadistic Latin teacher. When Widgren falls for a troubled local girl, Bertha, he finds himself caught up even further in a web of emotional mind games."
"Anna (Yvonne Sanson) flees her home, where she has been victimized for years by her spineless father's mean-spirited second wife, to be with her lover (Amedeo Nazzari), an honest businessman yet to make his fortune. When he is accused of a murder he didn't commit, the couple's domestic tranquillity is upended, and a desperate Anna must rely on her cruel stepmother to help support their child."
"Cousins James and Robert are in love with with the same woman, Susanna. When Robert and Susanna announce their engagement, James vows to ruin their happiness."
"Aki Kaurismäki's film of the Leningrad Cowboys’ massive concert in Helsinki’s Senate Square with the 150-member Alexandrov Red Army Chorus and Dance Ensemble is a loving tribute to the rock band he made famous. Seventy thousand people turned out for this megaspectacle; featuring musical selections from Sibelius to Bob Dylan, it crossed genre and national divides."
"The first film in Gregg Araki’s so-called Teenage Apocalypse Trilogy centers on six queer, alienated teenagers living in LA who form a makeshift family as they deal with the complications of love, money (or lack thereof), the AIDS crisis, and a homophobic society. Made as a gay response to the John Hughes–style teen movie, this landmark of the New Queer Cinema radiates the raw energy, underground cool, and nihilistic abandon that would become Araki’s signature."
"With his first English-language film, a critical and box-office disaster, Ingmar Bergman delivered a compelling portrait of conflicting desires. In THE TOUCH, a chance encounter between seemingly contented housewife Karin (Bibi Andersson) and David (Elliott Gould), an intense American archaeologist scarred by his family’s past, leads to the initiation of a torrid and tempestuous affair, one that eventually threatens the stability of Karin’s marriage to a respected local surgeon (Max von Sydow). Upon its release, the filmmaker declared this emotionally complex and sensitively performed film to be his first real love story."
"""Visionary"" barely begins to describe this masterpiece of Chinese cinema and martial arts moviemaking. A TOUCH OF ZEN (Xia nu) by King Hu depicts the journey of Yang, a fugitive noblewoman in disguise who seeks refuge in a remote, and allegedly haunted, village. The sanctuary she and her three companions find with a shy scholar is shattered when a nefarious swordsman uncovers her identity, pitting the five against legions of blade-wielding opponents. At once a wuxia film, the tale of a spiritual quest, and a study in human nature, A TOUCH OF ZEN is an unparalleled work in Hu's formidable career and an epic of the highest order, characterized by breathtaking action choreography, stunning widescreen landscapes, and innovative editing."
"With a stunning mix of the surreal and the naturalistic, Djibril Diop Mambéty paints a vivid, fractured portrait of Senegal in the early 1970s. In this French New Wave-influenced fantasy-drama, two young lovers long to leave Dakar for the glamour and comforts of France, but their escape plan is beset by complications both concrete and mystical. Characterized by dazzling imagery and music, the alternately manic and meditative TOUKI BOUKI is widely considered one of the most important African films ever made."
"In 1972, newly radicalized Hollywood star Jane Fonda joined forces with cinematic innovator Jean-Luc Godard and collaborator Jean-Pierre Gorin in an unholy artistic alliance that resulted in TOUT VA BIEN (EVERYTHING’S ALL RIGHT). This free-ranging assault on consumer capitalism and the establishment left tells the story of a wildcat strike at a sausage factory as witnessed by an American reporter (Fonda) and her has-been New Wave film director husband (Yves Montand). The Criterion Collection is proud to present this masterpiece of radical cinema, a caustic critique of society, marriage, and revolution in post-1968 France."
"On April 30, 1971, a standing-room-only crowd of New York’s intellectual elite packed the city’s Town Hall theater to see Norman Mailer—fresh from the controversy over his essay “The Prisoner of Sex” and the backlash it received from leaders of the women’s movement—tangle with a panel of four prominent female thinkers and activists: Jacqueline Ceballos, Germaine Greer, Jill Johnston, and Diana Trilling. Part intellectual death match, part three-ring circus, the proceedings were captured with crackling, fly-on-the-wall immediacy by the documentary great D. A. Pennebaker and a small crew, with Chris Hegedus later condensing the three-and-a-half-hour affair into this briskly entertaining snapshot of a singular cultural moment. Heady, heated, and hilarious, TOWN BLOODY HALL is a dazzling display of feminist firepower courtesy of some of the most influential figures of the era, with Mailer plainly relishing his role as the pugnacious rabble-rouser and literary lion at the center of it all."
"Linda (Theresa Russell), a childless woman in North Carolina, begins to fall in love with Martin (Gary Oldman), a young British man who may be the son she gave up for adoption when she was a teenager."
"When a fugitive begins a romance with the woman hiding him from the law, it becomes uncertain whether he will ever escape the shadow of his heinous crimes--or the detectives hot on his trail. Directed by Hideo Gosha."
"In Jacques Tati’s TRAFIC, the bumbling Monsieur Hulot, kitted out as always with tan raincoat, beaten brown hat, and umbrella, takes to Paris’s highways and byways. In this, his final outing, Hulot is employed as an auto company’s director of design, and accompanies his new product (a “camping car” outfitted with absurd gadgetry) to an auto show in Amsterdam. Naturally, the road there is paved with modern-age mishaps. This late-career delight is a masterful demonstration of the comic genius’s expert timing and sidesplitting knack for visual gags, and a bemused last look at technology run amok."
"While a film student in Łódź, Krzysztof Kieślowski made the 1966 silent short THE TRAM, about a flirtatious boy and a pretty girl. The film is presented here courtesy of the Polish National Film, Television, and Theatre School in Łódź."
"The beloved Moroccan band Nass El Ghiwane is the dynamic subject of this captivating musical documentary. Storytellers through song, with connections to political theater, the band became an international sensation (Western music critics have often referred to them as “the Rolling Stones of North Africa”) thanks to their political lyrics and sublime, fully acoustic sound, which draws on the Moroccan trance music tradition. Both a concert movie and a free-form audiovisual experiment, Ahmed El Maânouni's TRANCES is cinematic poetry."
"Dante transported to Times Square: a morbid and tender love story begins when a lonely girl drags home the naked body of a comatose, genital-less blonde woman."
"In THE TRANSFORMATION, Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio find one of the most engaging subjects of their previous documentary THE SALT MINES living as a man in Texas, forced to transition back by an evangelical missionary that offered her much-needed shelter and safety in exchange."
"A painterly and sensual immersion in late nineteenth-century Italian farm life, Ermanno Olmi’s THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS lovingly focuses on four families working for one landowner on an isolated estate in the province of Bergamo. Filming on an abandoned farm for four months, Olmi adapted neorealist techniques to tell his story, enlisting local people to live as their own ancestors had, speaking in their native dialect on locations with which they were intimately familiar. Through the cycle of seasons, of backbreaking labor, love and marriage, birth and death, faith and superstition, Olmi naturalistically evokes an existence very close to nature, celebrating its beauty, humor, and simplicity but also acknowledging the feudal cruelty that governs it. Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1978, THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS is intimate in scale but epic in scope, a towering, heart-stirring work of humanist filmmaking."
"One sunny day, seventeen-year-old Janek collapses in gym class. It’s the beginning of a mysterious, unsettling chain of events that will shake the entire school."
"Fourteen years after Hollywood ran aground with its film of Joan of Arc (starring Ingrid Bergman), French filmmaker Robert Bresson turned his attention to the last part of Joan's life, and the result was a stark and beautifully compact retelling of the tale, based on the actual surviving records of her trial. With Florence Delay as the martyred saint, in a presentation intended to make her accessible to modern younger viewers, the result was somewhere between a legitimate hagiographical film and the precursor to Zeffirelli's youth-oriented Romeo & Juliet, made a half-decade later."
"In a Paris prison cell, five inmates use every ounce of their tenacity and ingenuity in an elaborate attempt to tunnel to freedom. Based on the novel by José Giovanni, Jacques Becker’s LE TROU balances lyrical humanism with a tense, unshakable air of imminent danger."
A young woman (Isabelle Huppert) leaves behind her family's trout farm to accompany a playboy to Japan.
"In Ronald Neame’s TUNES OF GLORY, the incomparable Alec Guinness plays Jock Sinclair—a whiskey-drinking, up-by-the-bootstraps commanding officer of a peacetime Scottish battalion. A lifetime military man, Sinclair expects respect and loyalty from his men. But when Basil Barrow (John Mills)—an educated, by-the-book scion of a military family—enters the scene as Sinclair’s replacement, the two men engage in a fierce struggle for control of both the battalion and the hearts and minds of its men. Based on the novel by James Kennaway and featuring flawless performances by Guinness and Mills, TUNES OF GLORY uses the rigid stratification of military life to comment on the institutional contradictions and class hierarchies of English society, making for an unexpectedly moving drama."
"Bill Plympton’s first feature-length film incorporates elements from a handful of his early shorts into a kaleidoscopically oddball musical fantasia. Del is a songwriter for the obnoxious Mr. Mega and in love with Didi, Mega’s secretary. His quest to write a hit tune brings him to the wacky world of Flooby Nooby, where he just might learn to write songs from the heart. A canine Elvis impersonator, a psychotic bellhop, and a pair of shape-shifting businessmen duking it out in a demented grudge match are just a few of the outré inhabitants of Plympton’s wondrously warped universe."
"Directed by Rishi Chandna • 2017 • India

"The abiding strength of this documentary, the official film of the XIV Olympic Winter Games Sarajevo 1984, lies in its respect for the individual athletes, interviewing them before or after an event."
"Keisuke Kinoshita’s TWENTY-FOUR EYES (NIJUSHI NO HITOMI) is an elegant, emotional chronicle of a teacher’s unwavering commitment to her students, her profession, and her sense of morality. Set in a remote, rural island community and spanning decades of Japanese history, from 1928 through World War II and beyond, Kinoshita’s film takes a simultaneously sober and sentimental look at the epic themes of aging, war, and death, all from the lovingly intimate perspective of Hisako Oshi (Hideko Takamine), as she watches her pupils grow and deal with life’s harsh realities. Though little known in the United States, TWENTY-FOUR EYES is one of Japan’s most popular and enduring classics."
"In the town of Twin Peaks, everybody has their secrets, but no one more than Laura Palmer. In this prequel to his groundbreaking 1990s television series, David Lynch resurrects the teenager found wrapped in plastic at the beginning of the show, following her through the last week of her life and teasing out the enigmas that surround her murder. Homecoming queen by day and drug-addicted thrill seeker by night, Laura leads a double life that pulls her deeper and deeper into horror as she pieces together the identity of the assailant who has been terrorizing her for years. Nightmarish in its vision of an innocent torn apart by unfathomable forces, TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME is nevertheless one of Lynch's most humane films, aching with compassion for its tortured heroine, a character as enthralling in life as she was in death."
"Combining rare and often hilarious archival footage with engaging interviews, this documentary chronicles the evolution of the titular postwar rock ’n' roll dance craze that took America by storm. Featuring singers and musicians who helped define the phenomenon like Hank Ballard, Chubby Checker, and Joey Dee, as well as clips from TV shows like “American Bandstand,” TWIST tells the overlooked story of how shaking your hips went from being a sign of social degeneracy to the dance form that rocked the world."
"Two English Girls shows François Truffaut working in one of his favorite environments, the work of Henri-Pierre Roche (the author of Jules and Jim), with his longtime leading man/cinematic doppelganger Jean-Pierre Léaud, and telling a story so good on so many levels that he saved the narration for himself. As with many of Truffaut's best works (of which this is one, though it is often underrated), the story, of the romantic triangle between the two title characters and Léaud's Claude, is so beautifully delineated that the tale becomes almost secondary to its telling."
"The Ebony Film Corporation may have been a white-owned company, but African American producer Luther Pollard used it as a means of getting black faces on the silver screen, as in this slapstick comedy short. Luther often worked in collaboration with his brother Fritz, a star athlete who later became the first African American head coach in the NFL."
"Perhaps the best known of Roman Polanski’s shorts, TWO MEN AND A WARDROBE was his first to be screened publicly. It won five awards at international festivals. Polanski said in a 1966 interview, “When I filmed TWO MEN AND A WARDROBE, I tried . . . to keep myself within a . . . form that I believe proper to the short film. Strict, without dialogue.”"
"A young Jewish boy living in Nazi-occupied Paris is sent by his parents to the countryside to live with an elderly Catholic couple until France’s liberation. Forced to hide his identity, the eight-year-old, Claude (played delicately by first-time actor Alain Cohen), bonds with the irascible, staunchly anti-Semitic Grampa (Michel Simon), who improbably becomes his friend and confidant. Poignant and lighthearted, THE TWO OF US was acclaimed director Claude Berri’s debut feature, based on own childhood experiences, and gave the legendary Simon one of his most memorable roles in the twilight of his career."
"After shocking and outraging the world with his genre-defining 1963 gorefest BLOOD FEAST, exploitation pioneer Herschell Gordon Lewis outdid himself with the deliciously depraved TWO THOUSAND MANIACS! When a group of Yankee tourists take a detour and wind up in the small southern town of Pleasant Valley—which has magically rematerialized one hundred years after its destruction during the Civil War—they find themselves welcomed by the eager townsfolk as guests of honor at their centennial celebrations. Little do the northerners know that the festivities are set to include torture, death and dismemberment . . ."
"""A film without a beginning or an end,"" in Downey's words, this Dadaist thingamajig, a never-before-seen, newly reedited version of the director's 1975 release Moment to Moment (also known as Jive), is a rush of curious sketches, scenes, and shots that takes on a rhythmic life of its own. It stars Downey's multitalented wife, Elsie, in an endless succession of off-the-wall roles, from dancer to cocaine fiend."
"By the time he made UGETSU, Kenji Mizoguchi was already an elder statesman of Japanese cinema, fiercely revered by Akira Kurosawa and other directors of a younger generation. And with this exquisite ghost story, a fatalistic wartime tragedy derived from stories by Akinari Ueda and Guy de Maupassant, he created a touchstone of his art, his long takes and sweeping camera guiding the viewer through a delirious narrative about two villagers whose pursuit of fame and fortune leads them far astray from their loyal wives. Moving between the terrestrial and the otherworldly, UGETSU reveals essential truths about the ravages of war, the plight of women, and the pride of men."
"In this ruminative cross-pollination of film and photography, Agnès Varda uses a mysterious still image that she took in the late fifties—of a nude man (the photographer Guy Bourdin, a friend of hers) and a toddler on a rocky beach, flanked by a dead goat with a swelling belly in the foreground—as the springboard for a contemplation on the passing of time and the subjectivity of meaning in art."
"This neorealist masterpiece by Vittorio De Sica follows an elderly pensioner as he strives to make ends meet during Italy’s postwar economic recovery. Alone except for his dog, Flike, Umberto struggles to maintain his dignity in a city where human kindness seems to have been swallowed up by the forces of modernization. His simple quest to satisfy his basic needs—food, shelter, companionship—makes for one of the most heartbreaking stories ever filmed, and an essential classic of world cinema"
"UMBRELLAS takes a poignant, in-depth look at the concept and realization of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s project “Umbrellas.” The film presents the artists at their most triumphant and most vulnerable moments—from the exaltation of the project’s opening day through unexpected tragedies at the end."
"The angelically beautiful Catherine Deneuve was launched to stardom by this dazzling musical heart-tugger from Jacques Demy. She plays an umbrella-shop owner’s delicate daughter, glowing with first love for a handsome garage mechanic, played by Nino Castelnuovo. When the boy is shipped off to fight in Algeria, the two lovers must grow up quickly. Exquisitely designed in a kaleidoscope of colors, and told entirely through lilting songs by the great composer Michel Legrand, THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG is one of the most revered and unorthodox movie musicals of all time."
"A rich widow, nostalgic for the lavish parties of her youth, embarks on a journey to reconnect with the many suitors who once courted her. In doing so, she sets off on a course of discovery, both of herself and of how greatly the world has changed in two decades. Julien Duvivier's smash hit is a wry, visually inventive tale of romantic pragmatism that deftly combines comedy and drama."
This early short by Jaromil Jireš anticipates the formal and stylistic experimentation that would characterize VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS.
"Winner of the Palme d’Or, UNCLE BOONMEE WHO CAN RECALL HIS PAST LIVES is an unclassifiable tale of a man embracing life’s greatest mystery. Suffering from acute kidney failure, Uncle Boonmee has chosen to spend his final days surrounded by his loved ones in the countryside. Surprisingly, the ghost of his deceased wife appears to care for him, and his long-lost son returns home in a nonhuman form. Contemplating the reasons for his illness, Boonmee treks through the jungle with his family to a mysterious hilltop cave—the birthplace of his first life."
"In her effervescent first California film, Agnès Varda delves into her own family history. The short documentary UNCLE YANCO features Varda tracking down a Greek emigrant relative she’s never met, discovering an artist and kindred soul leading a bohemian life in Sausalito."
A mountain man beheads his many wives to prove his love to an alluring woman he meets in an enchanted forest. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda.
"In Renè Clair’s irrepressibly romantic portrait of the crowded tenements of Paris, a street singer and a gangster vie for the love of a beautiful young woman. This witty exploration of love and human foibles, told primarily through song, captures the flamboyant atmosphere of the city with sophisticated visuals and groundbreaking use of the new technology of movie sound. An international sensation upon its release, UNDER THE ROOFS OF PARIS is an exhilarating celebration of filmmaking and one of France's most beloved cinematic exports."
"Winner of the Palme d’Or at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival—where its victory was greeted with more than a bit of controversy—Maurice Pialat’s searing adaptation of a novel by Georges Bernanos stars Gérard Depardieu as a priest in the throes of a moral and spiritual crisis who channels his torment into saving the soul of a pregnant teenager (Sandrine Bonnaire) who has murdered her lover. Depardieu’s visceral performance and Pialat’s rigorous style come together to create an intense, shattering exploration of faith, sin, and salvation."
"UNDER THE VOLCANO follows the final day in the life of self-destructive British consul Geoffrey Firmin (Albert Finney, in an Oscar-nominated tour de force) on the eve of World War II. Withering from alcoholism, Firmin stumbles through a small Mexican village amidst the Day of the Dead fiesta, attempting to reconnect with his estranged wife (Jacqueline Bisset) but only further alienating himself. John Huston’s ambitious tackling of Malcolm Lowry’s towering “unadaptable” novel gave the incomparable Finney one of his grandest roles and was the legendary THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE director’s triumphant return to filmmaking in Mexico."
"In this musical melodrama set against the backdrop of a workers’ strike in Nantes, Dominique Sanda plays a young woman who wishes to leave her brutish husband (Michel Piccoli) for an earthy steelworker (Richard Berry), though he is involved with another. Unbeknownst to the girl, the object of her affection boards with her no-nonsense baroness mother (Danielle Darrieux). A late-career triumph from Jacques Demy, UNE CHAMBRE EN VILLE received nine César Award nominations and features a rich, operatic score by Michel Colombier."
"In this short film, a young woman tries to go to Paris, but her garden and the whole village is flooded with water."
"Brigitte Bardot was best-known as an actress (as opposed to a sex symbol) for her dramatic performances -- Michel Boisrond's Une Parisienne proved that she could be just as effective as a comedienne (getting her compared to Marilyn Monroe at her best), and hold her own alongside no less a figure than romantic leading man Charles Boyer. Between the two of them, and the movie's beautiful cinematography by Marcel Grignon, and Boisrond's lively, frothy direction of this story about a young married couple coping with fears of infidelity, Une Parisienne remains a treat for fans of Bardot, Boyer, or romantic comedies."
"Jean-Pierre Melville’s final film finds the legendary director paring his minimalist-cool style down to its essence as an impassive police detective (Alain Delon) and a daring bank robber (Richard Crenna) find themselves inextricably linked by their love for the same woman (Catherine Deneuve). The centerpiece of this masterfully stripped-down policier is a transfixing twenty-minute heist sequence involving a helicopter, a speeding train, and nary a word spoken."
"Amid the comings and goings at Union Depot, on-the-grift drifter Chick (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) and his pal Scrap Iron (Guy Kibbee) retrieve a dropped baggage-claim ticket and redeem it for a violin case that happens to contain a fortune in cash. When Chick uses the money to impress a down-on-her-luck chorus girl (Joan Blondell) who needs help getting to her next show (and eluding a deviant stalker), he fails to realize one thing: the bills he’s passing are counterfeit. Packing a sprawling, multistrand narrative into just over an hour, UNION DEPOT plays like the gritty Warner Bros. answer to GRAND HOTEL."
One of the major works of the structuralist film movement of the 1970s is a richly revealing portrait of Vietnam-era America as seen through the windshield of the filmmakers’ car while on a road trip from New York to Los Angeles.
"One of the first great films of the twenty-first century, Jia Zhangke’s third feature (and his first shot on digital) sets an arresting tale of disaffected youth against the backdrop of a changing China. Evoking the existential malaise of China’s so-called “birth control” generation—who came of age following the country’s one-child policy—UNKNOWN PLEASURES unfolds in a series of stunning, slow-burn long takes as it traces the relationship between an aimless teenage couple searching for meaning amid the detritus of Western pop culture."
"Anna (Kathryn Worth) arrives in Italy to stay with her school friend Verena (Mary Roscoe) and her family in their rented villa in Tuscany. Her partner Alex was meant to accompany her, but Anna tells Verena (at the last minute) that he has to stay in London due to his work. Over the course of the film it become apparent that Anna took the holiday to get some time away from Alex, following a heavy argument. Anna finds distraction in the company of the much younger Oakley (Tom Hiddleston, in his feature-film debut), but is eventually forced to confront her malaise head-on. "
"Conceived as the ultimate road movie, this decades-in-the-making science-fiction epic from Wim Wenders follows the restless Claire Tourneur (Solveig Dommartin) across continents as she pursues a mysterious stranger (William Hurt) in possession of a device that can make the blind see and bring dream images to waking life. With an eclectic soundtrack that gathers a host of the director’s favorite musicians, along with gorgeous cinematography by Robby Müller, this breathless adventure in the shadow of Armageddon takes its heroes to the ends of the earth and into the oneiric depths of their own souls. Presented here in its triumphant 287-minute director’s cut, UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD assumes its rightful place as Wenders’ magnum opus, a cosmic ode to the pleasures and perils of the image and a prescient meditation on cinema’s digital future."
"Cheryl Dunye examines her relationship with her in this collage of appropriated film footage, Super 8 home movies, and Dunye’s own wry brand of humor."
"With raw, harrowing honesty, photographer-filmmaker Khalik Allah explores the complex relationship between artist and subject as he reflects on his friendship with a homeless addict living on the streets of Harlem."
A famous Edo printmaker is pursued by five diverse women.
"Sandrine Bonnaire won the Best Actress César for her portrayal of the defiant young drifter Mona, found frozen to death in a ditch at the beginning of VAGABOND. Agnès Varda pieces together Mona’s story through flashbacks told by those who encountered her (played by a largely nonprofessional cast), producing a splintered portrait of an enigmatic woman. With its sparse, poetic imagery, VAGABOND (SANS TOIT NI LOI) is a stunner, and won Varda the top prize at the Venice Film Festival."
"A girl on the verge of womanhood finds herself in a sensual fantasyland of vampires, witchcraft, and other threats in this eerie and mystical movie daydream. VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS serves up an endlessly looping, nonlinear fairy tale, set in a quasi-medieval landscape. Ravishingly shot, enchantingly scored, and spilling over with surreal fancies, this enticing phantasmagoria from director Jaromil Jireš is among the most beautiful oddities of the Czechoslovak New Wave."
Jean Painlevé’s short THE VAMPIRE draws the connection between the movie monsters of the same name and the South American vampire bat. The animal’s gruesome feeding habits are on full display.
"With VAMPYR, Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer channeled his genius for creating mesmerizing atmosphere and austere, unsettling imagery into the horror genre. The result—a chilling film about a student of the occult who encounters supernatural haunts and local evildoers in a village outside of Paris—is nearly unclassifiable. A host of stunning camera and editing tricks and densely layered sounds create a mood of dreamlike terror. With its roiling fogs, ominous scythes, and foreboding echoes, VAMPYR is one of cinema’s great nightmares."
"Maurice Pialat’s visually stunning penultimate work is an epic, masterful dramatization of the final months in the life of the troubled painter (played by musician Jacques Dutronc in a César-winning performance) that focuses less on his creative genius and more on his complicated personal relationships with those in his orbit, including his brother Theo (Bernard Le Coq), doctor Paul Gachet (Gérard Séty), and the physician’s daughter Marguerite (Alexandra London) who becomes Vincent’s lover. Pialat’s sober, defiantly unsensational approach illuminates the human side of an artist whose legend has often obscured the complex, nuanced reality of his life."
"The filmmaker muses on the slang term of the title: is it who you do, or what you do?"
"A young man embarks on an obsessive search for the girlfriend who mysteriously disappeared while the couple were taking a sunny vacation trip, and his three-year investigation draws the attention of her abductor, a mild-mannered professor with a clinically diabolical mind. An unorthodox love story and a truly unsettling thriller, Dutch filmmaker George Sluizer’s THE VANISHING unfolds with meticulous intensity, leading to an unforgettable finale that has unnerved audiences around the world."
"The final film from the late, beloved Agnès Varda is a characteristically playful, profound, and personal summation of the director’s own brilliant career. At once impish and wise, Varda acts as our spirit guide on a free-associative tour through her six-decade artistic journey, shedding new light on her films, photography, and recent installation works while offering her one-of-a-kind reflections on everything from filmmaking to feminism to aging. Suffused with the people, places, and things she loved—Jacques Demy, cats, colors, beaches, heart-shaped potatoes—the wonderfully idiosyncratic work of imaginative autobiography VARDA BY AGNÈS is a warmly human, touchingly bittersweet parting gift from one of cinema’s most luminous talents."
"The provocative, sexually charged tale of a woman’s journey of self-discovery, Bette Gordon’s independent landmark offers a bold challenge to conventional notions of feminism and pornography. Emerging out of New York City’s 1980s artistic underground, VARIETY follows Christine (Sandy McLeod), a bright and unassuming young woman who takes a job selling tickets at a porno theater near Times Square. Instead of distancing herself from the dark and erotic nature of her new milieu, Christine soon develops an obsession that begins to consume her life. Featuring contributions from a variety of counterculture luminaries—including cult novelist Kathy Acker, who cowrote the script; musician John Lurie; and photographer Nan Goldin—VARIETY remains revolutionary in its fearless exploration of erotic fantasy from a woman’s point of view."
"A remake of director Oscar Micheaux’s (now lost) 1925 film THE HOUSE BEHIND THE CEDARS, VEILED ARISTOCRATS exists in incomplete form, but the missing footage does not impair one’s enjoyment of this drama—punctuated with song-and-dance numbers—of a woman wrestling with the decision of whether to marry a successful light-skinned man or an idealistic entrepreneur of darker complexion."
"Scripted by Akira Kurosawa and directed by period specialist Kazuo Mori, this revisionist samurai tale stars the mighty Toshiro Mifune as legendary swordsman Mataemon Araki, who aids a young man in his quest to avenge the killing of a family member. Based on a famous incident in Japanese history, VENDETTA OF A SAMURAI plays intriguingly with the concept of truth as it sets out to separate reality from myth. Fellow Kurosawa regular Takashi Shimura costars alongside a supporting cast that includes several future SEVEN SAMURAI players."
"A thief, a murderer, and a charming lady-killer, Iwao Enokizu (Ken Ogata) is on the run from the police. Director Shohei Imamura turns this fact-based story—about the seventy-eight-day killing spree of a remorseless man from a devoutly Catholic family—into a cold, perverse, and at times diabolically funny examination of the primitive coexisting with the modern. More than just a true-crime tale, VENGEANCE IS MINE bares humanity’s snarling id."
In this surreal filmed pageant—presided over by a horrific skull-faced jailer in a nun’s habit—a woman faces the throne of judgment and must account her iniquities to earn God’s mercy.
"Vernon is a town in the Florida panhandle surrounded by swamps. Here, Errol Morris found the quietly fascinating subjects for the follow-up to his galvanizing debut, GATES OF HEAVEN. As ever humane yet sharply focused, Morris lets his camera subjects pontificate and perambulate the environs of this seemingly unremarkable little community. The result is a strangely philosophical work that cemented its director’s standing as an important figure in American film."
"A once-beloved Third Reich–era starlet, Veronika Voss (Rosel Zech) lives in obscurity in postwar Munich. Struggling for survival and haunted by past glories, she encounters sportswriter Robert Krohn (Hilmar Thate) in a rain-swept park and intrigues him with her mysterious beauty. As their unlikely relationship develops, Robert comes to discover the dark secrets that brought about the decline of Veronika’s career. Based on the true story of a World War II Ufa star, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s VERONIKA VOSS is wicked satire disguised as a 1950s melodrama."
"In this short film from director Eric Rohmer, Véronique tutors a perplexing young boy."
"An extraordinary performance by Dirk Bogarde grounds this intense, sobering indictment of early-sixties social intolerance and sexual puritanism. Bogarde plays Melville Farr, a married barrister who is one of a large group of closeted London men who become targets of a blackmailer. Basil Dearden's unmistakably political taboo buster was one of the first films to address homophobia head-on, a cry of protest against British laws forbidding homosexuality."
"This deadpan tragicomedy about a group of impoverished, outcast artists living the bohemian life in Paris is among the most beguiling films by Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki. Based on stories from Henri Murger’s influential mid-nineteenth-century book “Scènes de la vie de bohème” (the basis for the opera “La bohème”), the film features a marvelous trio of Kaurismäki regulars—André Wilms, Matti Pellonpää, and Karl Väänänen—as a writer, painter, and composer who scrape by together, sharing in life’s daily absurdities. Gorgeously shot in black and white, LA VIE DE BOHÈME is a vibrantly scrappy rendition of a beloved tale."
"With his stunning debut feature, the risk-taking auteur Bruno Dumont immediately established his reputation as an uncompromising iconoclast on the cutting edge of French cinema. Blending unflinching realism with moments of startling, light-filled beauty, LA VIE DE JÉSUS finds unexpected philosophical richness in the quotidian, small-town existence of Freddy (nonprofessional David Douche in a revelatory, one-off performance), an aimless young man with epilepsy who, in his childlike simplicity, embodies both great tenderness and terrifying brutality. Leaving the film’s cryptic title tantalizingly open to interpretation, Dumont dares viewers to see the divine in a seemingly dead-end world."
"This 37-minute film was made by Jean Cocteau in 1951, on 16 mm Kodachrome. It features a tour of his decorative art at the villa Santo-Sospir and of his home in Villefranche-sur-Mer."
"Violence at Noon concerns the odd circumstances surrounding a horrific murder and rape spree. In a twist, the film is as much about the two women who protect the violent man, his wife and a former victim, as it is about him. Containing more than two thousand cuts and a wealth of inventive widescreen compositions, this coolly fragmented character study is a mesmerizing investigation of criminality and social decay."
"Barbara Stanwyck is a frontier femme fatale in this simmering psychosexual western, in which she plays the scheming, faithless wife of a greedy landowner (Edward G. Robinson) who uses his influence to force nearby ranch owners off their land in a ruthless quest to control the entire region. When the pair push a peace-loving Civil War veteran (Glenn Ford) too far, he is forced to abandon his pacifist ways. The powerhouse performances, striking CinemaScope photography, and stirring score by Max Steiner come together in an operatic saga of power and revenge."
"Winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, Ingmar Bergman’s THE VIRGIN SPRING is a harrowing tale of faith, revenge, and savagery in medieval Sweden. With austere simplicity, the director tells the story of the rape and murder of the virgin Karin, and her father Töre’s ruthless pursuit of vengeance against the three killers. Starring Max von Sydow and photographed by the brilliant Sven Nykvist, the film is both beautiful and cruel in its depiction of a world teetering between paganism and Christianity."
"With this debut feature, Sofia Coppola announced her singular vision, exploring the aesthetics of femininity while illuminating the interior lives of young women. An adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides’s popular first novel, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES conjures the ineffable melancholy of teenage longing and ennui in its story of the suicides of the five Lisbon sisters, stifled by the rules of their overprotective religious parents—as told through the collective memory of a group of men who were boys at the time and still yearn to understand what happened. Evoking its 1970s suburban setting through ethereal cinematography by Ed Lachman and an atmospheric score by Air, the film secured a place for its director in the landscape of American independent cinema and has become a coming-of-age touchstone."
"Banned in Spain and denounced by the Vatican, Luis Buñuel’s irreverent vision of life as a beggar’s banquet is regarded by many as his masterpiece. In it, novice nun Viridiana does her utmost to maintain her Catholic principles, but her lecherous uncle and a motley assemblage of paupers force her to confront the limits of her idealism. Winner of the Palme d’or at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival, VIRIDIANA is as audacious today as ever."
"VISIONS OF EIGHT, David Wolper's ambitious production devoted to the Games of the XX Olympiad Munich 1972, comprises eight segments by an impressive international array of directors, including established auteurs MiloÀás Forman, Arthur Penn, Claude Lelouch, and John Schlesinger."
"Surrealistic and strange, cast in grainy 16 mm images, VISITATION allows an imaginary glimpse into the aura of “an outer-world night.” The visions in the film are summoned from the filmmaker’s imagining of a mythical eternity that is beautiful but fraught with pain, exposed by the ether voices and figures which inhabit the eternal ballet beneath our consciousness. “My mood at the time had served to aggravate those deeply inhuman and most terrible beings when they came with total abandonment from where they had lurked amongst the stones and wet woods . . .” With these lines, VISITATION unwinds through a hand-painted heavenly hell of unending life and death. Steeped in the alchemical and inner dream life, the film explores a black-and-white landscape of gothic figures who enact evolving metaphysical dramas. Using painted cut-outs and early-cinema techniques (multiple passes, mattes, multi-plane levels, in-camera superimpositions, shutter manipulation, etc.) the film was shot with a 16 mm Bolex camera in black and white, which gives it a grainy, handmade look. The abstract passages were created by placing objects directly onto raw film and exposing the film with a flashlight. Thus the film’s process mirrors the alchemical nature of chemical, material, and metaphysical experimentation."
"A work of poetry and dark humor, LES VISITEURS DU SOIR is a lyrical medieval fantasy from the great French director Marcel Carné. Two strangers dressed as minstrels (Arletty and Alain Cuny) arrive at a castle in advance of court festivities—and are revealed to be emissaries of the devil, dispatched to spread heartbreak and suffering. Their plans, however, are thwarted by an unexpected intrusion: human love. Often interpreted as an allegory for the Nazi occupation of France, during which it was made, LES VISITEURS DU SOIR—wittily written by Jacques Prévert and Pierre Laroche, and elegantly designed by Alexandre Trauner and shot by Roger Hubert—is a moving tale of love conquering all."
"Lucy (Anna Biller), a young Victorian woman in the Old West, is being tormented by nightly visits from an incubus (a horrible demon who has sexual intercourse with sleeping women). Her friend Madeleine (Natalia Schroeder) tries to console her, but is unable to help. A fallen woman, Lucy gets a job singing at the local saloon. However, the incubus (Jared Sanford) has followed her there; and things take an unexpected turn as Lucy and the incubus, amid the rowdy cowboys and saucy can-can girls, have their final showdown. With beautiful period costumes and sets by director Anna Biller that emulate 1950s Technicolor films, plus big hairdos, weird musical numbers, and plenty of great character actors, this horror-western-musical has all of the elements of a cult classic."
"This short documentary about opera singer Maria Fołtyn was directed by Agnieszka Smoczyńska in 2010, while she was a film student at the Wajda School in Warsaw."
"In his short documentary Vive le Tour, Louis Malle presents his energetic evocation of the Tour de France. This, Humain, trop humain, and Place de la République, Louis Malle's three French-set documentaries, reveal, in an eclectic array of ways, the director's eternal fascination with, and respect for, the everyday lives of everyday people."
"Vivre sa vie was a turning point for Jean-Luc Godard and remains one of his most dynamic films, combining brilliant visual design with a tragic character study. The lovely Anna Karina, Godard's greatest muse, plays Nana, a young Parisian who aspires to be an actress but instead ends up a prostitute, her downward spiral depicted in a series of discrete tableaux of daydreams and dances. Featuring some of Karina and Godard's most iconic moments, from her movie theater vigil with The Passion of Joan of Arc to her seductive pool-hall strut, Vivre sa vie is a landmark of the French New Wave that still surprises at every turn."
"Ghostly images of Colombia’s jungle landscapes are set to radio transmissions sent by family members to their kidnapped loved ones—heartrending messages of grief, support, and, against all odds, hope."
A man goes on a surreal odyssey through Miami's psychedelic underworld in search of his wife's missing voice.
"During WWII, Ralph Richardson suggested that Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger make a recruitment film for the Fleet Air Arm, which both he and Laurence Olivier had joined. Pressburger proposed a “semidocumentary,” which resulted in THE VOLUNTEER (1943), starring Richardson and featuring a brief guest appearance by Olivier. Criterion is pleased to present the original, 46-minute version of the film, rarely seen in the United States."
"Volker Schlöndorff’s richly absorbing adaptation of Swiss writer Max Frisch’s celebrated novel “Homo Faber” follows the journey of Walter Faber (Sam Shepard), an American construction engineer whose relentlessly rational worldview is continually challenged as he travels across the world in the late 1950s and becomes involved with a young woman (Julie Delpy) with whom he shares a startling connection. Strikingly shot around the globe—from Mexico to New York to Paris to Greece and beyond—VOYAGER is a thought-provoking, deeply affecting consideration of the role of fate in the modern world."
"On assignment for the mathematics department of le Palais de la Découverte, Jean Painlevé shot this film to be presented at the Paris museum’s 1937 international exhibition. VOYAGE TO THE SKY muses on extraterrestrial landscapes and earth’s role in the universe."
"In a squalid South American oil town, four desperate men sign on for a suicide mission to drive trucks loaded with nitroglycerin over a treacherous mountain route. As they ferry their explosive cargo to a faraway oil fire, each bump and jolt tests their courage, their friendship, and their nerves. The result is one of the greatest thrillers ever committed to celluloid, a white-knuckle ride from France’s legendary master of suspense, Henri-Georges Clouzot."
"While at a summerhouse, awaiting their husbands’ return, a group of sisters-in-law recount stories from their respective marriages. Rakel (Anita Björk) tells of receiving a visit from a former lover (Jarl Kulle); Marta (Maj-Britt Nilsson) of agreeing to marry a painter (Birger Malmsten) only after having his child; and Karin (Eva Dahlbeck) of being stuck with her husband (Gunnar Björnstrand) in an elevator, where they talk intimately for the first time in years. Making dexterous use of flashbacks, the engaging WAITING WOMEN is a veritable seedbed of Ingmar Bergman themes, ranging from aspiring young love to the fear of loneliness, with the finale a masterpiece of chamber comedy."
"A young sister and brother are abandoned in the harsh Australian outback and must learn to cope in the natural world, without their usual comforts, in this hypnotic masterpiece from Nicolas Roeg. Along the way, they meet a young aborigine on his “walkabout,” a rite of passage in which adolescent boys are initiated into manhood by journeying into the wilderness alone. WALKABOUT is a thrilling adventure as well as a provocative rumination on time and civilization."
"In Yasujiro Ozu's WALK CHEERFULLY, which gracefully combines elements of the relationship drama and the gangster story, small-time hood Kenji, a.k.a. Ken the Knife, wants to go straight for good girl Yasue but finds that starting over isn't as simple as it sounds. This was the Japanese master's first true homage to American crime movies, and it is a fleetly told, expressively shot work of humor and emotional depth."
"Genre specialist John Sturges lends considerable tension and excitement to this taut tale of gold fever and the desperate lengths to which it drives men. Western icon Randolph Scott is one of eight adventurers whose search for a wagon train full of gold draws them together in a seemingly doomed excursion into Death Valley—with murder, romantic rivalry, and a sensational sandstorm along the way. Pioneering folk and blues legend Josh White costars and lends musical accompaniment."
"Ten years after the passing of his wife and creative partner, Jeanne-Claude, Christo sets out to realize “The Floating Piers,” a project they conceived together many years before. Boasting complete access to the artist and his team, WALKING ON WATER is an unprecedented look at Christo’s process, from the inception through the completion of his latest large-scale art installation, a dahlia-yellow walkway atop Italy’s Lake Iseo that was eventually experienced by over 1.2 million people. The film takes the viewer on an intimate journey into Christo’s world amid mounting madness—from complex dealings between art and state politics to engineering challenges, logistical nightmares, and the sheer force of nature. Through breathtaking aerial views and fly-on-the-wall camera work, director Anrey Paounov lets us watch the artist’s vision unfold, and get to know the man chasing it."
"Meant as a day to celebrate the arrival of spring, Walpurgis Night brings about a chilly course of events for Johan, his wife Clary, and his secretary Lena. An unhappy marriage leaves this trio out in the cold."
"With her first and only feature film—a hard-luck drama she wrote, directed, and starred in—Barbara Loden turned in a groundbreaking work of American independent cinema, bringing to life a kind of character seldom seen on-screen. Set amid a soot-choked Pennsylvania landscape, and shot in an intensely intimate vérité style, the film takes up with distant and soft-spoken Wanda (Loden), who has left her husband, lost custody of her children, and now finds herself alone, drifting between dingy bars and motels, where she falls prey to a series of callous men—including a bank robber who ropes her into his next criminal scheme. An until now difficult-to-see masterpiece that has nonetheless exerted an outsize influence on generations of artists and filmmakers, WANDA is a compassionate and wrenching portrait of a woman stranded on society’s margins."
"ANDREI BOLKONSKY

"After escaping a laboratory, two giant ape-like humanoids battle it out over Tokyo."
"A juvenile delinquent gets out of the pen and immediately embarks on a rampage of untethered anger, most of it directed at the girlfriend of the journalist who helped send him up. Shot through with the same kind of bebop bravado that Godard was experimenting with half a world away, the anarchic descent into amoral madness that is The Warped Ones (Kyonetsu no kisetsu) sounded a lost generation's cry for help and was one of the films that kicked off Japan's cinematic sixties with a bang."
"For his enthralling first feature, Allan King took his cameras to a home for emotionally disturbed young people. Situated inside the facility like a fly on the wall, we witness the full spectrum of emotions displayed by twelve fascinating children and the caregivers trying to nurture and guide them. The stunning WARRENDALE won the Prix d'art et d'essai at Cannes and a special documentary award from the National Society of Film Critics."
"The 1992 presidential election was a triumph not only for Bill Clinton but also for the new breed of strategists who guided him to the White House—and changed the face of politics in the process. For this thrilling, behind-closed-doors account of that campaign, renowned cinema verité filmmakers Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker captured the brainstorming and bull sessions of Clinton’s crack team of consultants—especially James Carville and George Stephanopoulos, who became media stars in their own right as they injected a savvy, youthful spirit and spontaneity into the process of campaigning. Fleet-footed and entertaining, THE WAR ROOM is a vivid document of a political moment whose truths (“It’s the economy, stupid!”) still ring in our ears."
"Washingtonia starts when the giraffes heart can no longer be heard. Washingtonia is an alternative name for Athens, a place where people, like animals, fall into summertime sadness because of the heat. Washingtonia is the only palm tree that its heart is not devoured by the red beetle. Because it's heart is small and dry and no one likes small and dry hearts."
Andrea Arnold’s Oscar-winning short film details the struggles of a young mother who feels that her children are preventing her from rekindling an old relationship.
"This thirteen-minute short, written by Jacques Tati and directed by René Clément, stars Tati as a farmer who dreams of becoming a boxer but is ill-prepped when he gets his wish."
"Michael Caine stars as the Governor of Cascara, a relaxed British colony. When fresh mineral water is found in the area, the colony descends into chaos."
"During a summer in Paris, a love triangle develops between three girls in this provocative and perceptive portrait of teen angst and nascent sexuality. The awkward Anne, the bad girl Floriane, and the gawky Marie play an intense game of emotional chess as they wrestle with love, friendship, and their desire for one another."
"Cheryl Dunye’s bitingly funny, deeply personal feature debut is a landmark look at the black lesbian experience. The director herself stars as Cheryl, a twenty-something lesbian struggling to make a documentary about Fae Richards, a beautiful and elusive 1930s black film actress popularly known as the Watermelon Woman. While uncovering the meaning of Richards’s life, Cheryl simultaneously experiences a total upheaval in her own when she embarks on an affair with a white woman (Guinevere Turner). Soon, each answer Cheryl discovers about the Watermelon Woman evokes a flurry of new questions about herself and her future."
"With this passion project, screenwriter-producer-director Martin Rosen brilliantly achieved what had been thought nearly impossible: a faithful big-screen adaptation of Richard Adams’s classic British dystopian novel about a community of rabbits under terrible threat from modern forces. With its naturalistic hand-drawn animation, dreamily expressionistic touches, gorgeously bucolic background design, and elegant voice work from such superb English actors as John Hurt, Ralph Richardson, Richard Briers, and Denholm Elliott, WATERSHIP DOWN is an emotionally arresting, dark-toned allegory about freedom amid political turmoil."
"Sex, musical numbers, and watermelons collide in the most daringly outrageous film yet from visionary director Tsai Ming-liang. In a drought-stricken Taipei where water is so scarce that people have taken to drinking watermelon juice for sustenance, a pornographic actor (Tsai regular Lee Kang-sheng) and a museum tour guide (Chen Shiang-chyi) find themselves drawn together by fate—but will they ever truly connect? Punctuated by surrealist production numbers that play like MGM extravaganzas gone avant-garde, THE WAYWARD CLOUD blends high camp and genuine human feeling into a fantastically strange, singular romance."
A London bachelor (Roland Young) must marry off the women to whom his grandmother introduces him in hopes of avoiding matrimony.
A jewelry store president begins to fall for the doctor treating her husband's illness. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"This sensual, remarkably observed, beautifully acted wonder is the breakout feature from British writer-director-editor Andrew Haigh. Rarely has a film been as honest about sexuality—in both depiction and discussion—as this tale of a one-night stand that develops into a weekend-long idyll for two very different young men (exciting screen newcomers Tom Cullen and Chris New) in the English Midlands. It’s an emotionally naked film that’s at once an invaluable snapshot of the complexities of contemporary gay living and a universally resonant portrait of a love affair."
"This scathing late-sixties satire from Jean-Luc Godard is one of cinema’s great anarchic works. Determined to collect an inheritance from a dying relative, a bourgeois couple travel across the French countryside while civilization crashes and burns around them. Featuring a justly famous sequence in which the camera tracks along a seemingly endless traffic jam, and rich with historical and literary references, WEEKEND is a surreally funny and disturbing call for revolution, a depiction of society reverting to savagery, and—according to the credits—the end of cinema itself."
"A surreal rush of impressionistic hand-drawn animation evokes, sans dialogue, the dream world of a young boy growing up in Toronto as he bounces between the disparate worlds of his divorced parents."
"Harold Bledsoe, a botanist and the son of a successful police chief, is brought to San Francisco to help investigate a growing crime wave."
"After finding out that North American people are visiting the Spanish villages, the citizens of Villar del Río start preparing themselves to welcome them when they arrive."
Children fight against the strict rules and regulations they face during their time in a Communist Young Pioneer camp.
"A deeply moving tribute to the Texas songster, Mance Lipscomb, considered by many to be the greatest guitarist of all time."
Two siblings accidentally pick up a hitchhiker on their way to the zoo.
"As a result of a lost bet with his assistant, Errol Morris, director Werner Herzog must eat his own shoe."
"In this nonfiction spin on the myths of the frontier, Americana specialists the Ross brothers create an immersive portrait of Eagle Pass, Texas, a border town that has historically enjoyed a close relationship with Piedras Negras on the Mexican side. As drug-cartel violence and fearmongering politics intrude on the community, though, the border hardens and disrupts local ways of life. Focusing on two larger-than-life characters—a veteran cattleman and Eagle Pass’s charismatic mayor—WESTERN is a vividly lived-in study of a region often distorted by the national political conversation."
"G. W. Pabst brought the war movie into a new era with his first sound film, a mercilessly realistic depiction of the nightmare that scarred a generation, in Germany and beyond. Digging into the trenches with four infantrymen stationed in France in the final months of World War I, Pabst illustrates the harrowing ordeals of battle with unprecedented naturalism, as the men are worn away in body and spirit by firefights, shelling, and the disillusion that greets them on the home front. Long unavailable, the newly restored WESTFRONT 1918 is a visceral, sobering antiwar statement that is as urgent today as when it was made."
"An end-of-love story for the ages, Maurice Pialat’s masterpiece is a combustible portrait of a couple whose mutual desire tears them apart. A work of lacerating autobiography drawn from the director’s own experiences, WE WON’T GROW OLD TOGETHER follows married, forty-year-old filmmaker Jean (Jean Yanne) and his young, working-class lover Catherine (Marlène Jobert) as they engage in a circular series of spectacular blowups and tentative reunions, their love for one another a fire that burns them again and again. The director’s use of destabilizing jump cuts and claustrophobic spaces pushes the relentless emotional intensity to harrowing heights."
"When modern, liberated Setsuko visits her uncle Komiya, she is appalled by how he is dominated by his socialite wife and tries to get him to 'man up.'"
This giddily experimental student film by Martin Scorsese employs a jumble of freewheeling optical effects as it tells the surreal story of a man who becomes increasingly obsessed with a picture hanging on his wall.
"Director Roman Polanski got the idea for his senior thesis from an article about a lavatory attendant who claimed to have had a mystical vision. “A lavatory attendant’s life seemed to epitomize vacuity, drudgery, monotony,” he recalled in his autobiography. “Nobody would ever . . . conceive of her having had a life imbued with passion and drama.”"
"WHEN A WOMAN ASCENDS THE STAIRS might be Japanese filmmaker Mikio Naruse’s finest hour, a delicate, devastating study of a woman, Keiko (played heartbreakingly by Hideko Takamine), who works as a bar hostess in Tokyo’s very modern postwar Ginza district, who entertains businessmen after work. Sly, resourceful, but trapped, Keiko comes to embody the conflicts and struggles of a woman trying to establish her independence in a male-dominated society. WHEN A WOMAN ASCENDS THE STAIRS shows the largely unsung yet widely beloved master Naruse at his most socially exacting and profoundly emotional."
Charles Burnett paints a jazz- and poetry-inflected portrait of African American community and resilience via the story of a mother who enlists a musician’s help when she is evicted on New Year’s Day.
"A down-and-out jazz musician (Alfred Molina) is launched on a road to redemption when he comes into possession of a rocking chair haunted by two benign ghosts: a formidable middle-aged woman (Marianne Faithfull) and a precocious young girl (Rachael Bella), each of whom died in the chair decades apart. Full of surrealist flights of fancy and charmingly oddball touches, Sara Driver’s second (and to date last) narrative feature is a DIY delight graced with an anthemic score by the Clash’s Joe Strummer and the dreamy cinematography of the great Robby Müller."
"Filmed during Hurricane Isaac, WHEN WE LIVED IN MIAMI is a hypnotic short about the lengths one woman will go to keep her family from falling apart."
"The first film in Abbas Kiarostami’s sublime, interlacing KOKER TRILOGY takes a simple premise—a boy searches for the home of his classmate, whose school notebook he has accidentally taken—and transforms it into a miraculous, child’s-eye adventure of the everyday. As our young hero zigzags determinedly across two towns, aided (and sometimes misdirected) by those he encounters, his quest becomes both a revealing portrait of rural Iranian society in all its richness and complexity and a touching parable about the meaning of personal responsibility. Sensitive and profound, WHERE IS THE FRIEND’S HOUSE? is shot through with all the beauty, tension, and wonder a single day can contain."
"When a young man inherits his father's lucrative business, he cheats the system to set up three of his college friends with jobs. (Presented without score.)"
"Part one of Director Hannu Leminen's account of the Olympic Games Helsinki 1952, with its fierce patriotism and its sense of a nation welcoming the world, is redolent of the period, coming as it did only twelve years after the end of Finland's war with the Soviet Union, and seven years after the end of World War II. WHERE THE WORLD MEETS focuses on the opening ceremony and track & field events."
"In The White Angel,, Raffaello Matarazzo's sequel to his blockbuster Nobody's Children, the perpetually put-upon Guido and Luisa (Amedeo Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson) return for a new round of trials and tribulations. This time, the reversals of fortune are even more insanely ornate, a plot twist involving doppelgängers beats Vertigo to the punch by three years, and the whole thing climaxes with a jaw-dropping women-in-prison set piece."
"Jafar Panahi’s revelatory debut feature is a child’s-eye adventure in which a young girl’s quest to buy a goldfish leads her on a detour-filled journey through the streets of Tehran on the eve of the Iranian New Year celebration. Cowritten by Panahi with his mentor Abbas Kiarostami, this beguiling, prizewinning fable unfolds in documentary-like real time as it wrings unexpected comedy, suspense, and wonder from its seemingly simple premise."
"In the south of France, in a vast plain region called the Camargue, lives White Mane, a magnificent stallion and the leader of a herd of wild horses too proud to let themselves be broken by humans. Only Folco, a young fisherman, manages to tame him. A strong friendship grows between the boy and the horse, as the two go looking for the freedom that the world of men won't allow them. Long unavailable in the U.S., this extraordinarily shot wonder from Albert Lamorisse, the director of The Red Balloon, is a work of technical sophistication and immense natural beauty."
"In WHITE MATERIAL, the great contemporary French filmmaker Claire Denis, known for her restless, intimate dramas, introduces an unforgettably crazed character. Played by a ferocious Isabelle Huppert, Maria is an entitled white woman living in Africa, desperately unwilling to give up her family’s crumbling coffee plantation despite the civil war closing in on her. Created with Denis’ signature full-throttle visual style, which places the viewer at the center of the maelstrom, WHITE MATERIAL is a gripping evocation of the death throes of European colonialism and a fascinating look at a woman lost in her own mind."
"British documentary film-maker and producer Tony Maylam invigorated the sports documentary genre with White Rock, an idiosyncratic and utterly engaging account of the XII Olympic Winter Games Innsbruck 1976. He did so by placing music front and center, and by using Hollywood star James Coburn as a ""guide for the uninitiated."""
"THE WHITE STADIUM (Das Weisse Stadion), the film of the II Olympic Winter Games St. Moritz 1928 in Switzerland, holds particular interest because it was directed by Arnold Fanck, a geologist turned filmmaker known for his sumptuous outdoor cinematography and his aesthete's eye for filming natural landscapes. On a technical level, THE WHITE STADIUM exemplifies the rapid progress in Olympic films where cameras and montage are concerned."
"WHITE VERTIGO is one of the unexpected jewels of this Olympic films collection. The cinematography is by none other than Aldo Scavarda, who would film L'AVVENTURA for Michelangelo Antonioni three and a half years later. Director Giorgio Ferroni knows how to film the key disciplines, even if they are far removed from his specialties, the sword- and-sandal and pulp fiction genres. The music, by the prolific Angelo Francesco Lavagnino (OTHELLO and CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT), audaciously uses jazz piano to accompany the ice hockey matches, bringing a lyrical mood to a sport that in other Olympic Games documentaries is portrayed in ferocious terms."
"After nearly a decade as American Vogue's most subversive fashion photographer, William Klein made this wild, pseudovérité incursion into the world of Parisian haute couture. Elegant, scathing humor ties together the various strands of this alternately glamorous and grotesque portrait of American in Paris Polly Maggoo (Dorothy MacGowan), an Alice in Wonderland supermodel who becomes the pinup plaything of media hounds and the fragmented fantasy of haunted Prince Igor (Sami Frey). Klein's first fiction film is a daring deflation of cultural pretensions and institutions, dressed up in brilliant black and white."
A hypochondriac vacations in the tropics for the fresh air-- and finds himself in the middle of a revolution instead.
"Margaret Lockwood devours the screen as a tightly wound seventeenth-century beauty with loose morals, who steals her best friend’s wealthy fiancé on the eve of their wedding. And that's only the beginning of this piece of pulp from director Leslie Arliss, there are no depths to which this sinful woman won’t sink. James Mason costars, and nearly steals the movie, as a highwayman with whom our antiheroine becomes entangled. This nasty, subversive treat was the most commercially successful of all the Gainsborough melodramas."
"Based on a novel by master crime writer Georges Simenon, this quietly gripping drama centers on the unexpected relationship that develops between a hard-bitten country widow (Simone Signoret) and a mysterious outlaw (Alain Delon) as they become bound together in a struggle against her brutish in-laws. Set against the rising tide of fascism in 1930s France, THE WIDOW COUDERC is a superb showcase for the chemistry between French cinema icons Delon and Signoret, with the latter delivering one of the finest of her formidable late-career performances."
"A novel by Fumiko Hiyashi provided that basis for this unusual work by Mikio Naruse -- Wife (aka Tsuma) (1953) tells the story of a decade-old marriage in the process of disintegrating. Opening and closing with the same sequence of the husband silently leaving home, the real focus of the story -- as with more Naruse films -- is the wife, who decides to take desperate measures to try and hold her marriage together, including foresaking her accepted obligations. The result is a drama with some near-comical, battle-of-the-sexes type overtones that are unusual for Naruse, though the tone is still rooted in domestic tragedy and the message seems to be a wider-ranging one concerning the stresses of life in postwar Japan."
"Norman Mailer's first feature filmmaking effort stars the director and his two longtime collaborators Buzz Farbar and Mickey Knox as a trio of gangsters holed up in a ramshackle New York apartment, drinking, braying, and fighting. Mailer once claimed that he viewed making movies as ""free psychoanalysis,"" and this bristly, stripped-down experiment in improvisation shows a filmmaker baring himself for all to see."
"Hideko Takamine stars as Otama, a young woman who is forced to become a mistress to a married, middle-aged man in order to support her father, in this meiji period drama directed by Shiro Toyoda."
"Traveling to accept an honorary degree, Professor Isak Borg—masterfully played by the veteran filmmaker and actor Victor Sjöström—is forced to face his past, come to terms with his faults, and make peace with the inevitability of his approaching death. Through flashbacks and fantasies, dreams and nightmares, WILD STRAWBERRIES dramatizes one man’s remarkable voyage of self-discovery. This richly humane masterpiece, full of iconic imagery, is one of Ingmar Bergman’s most widely acclaimed and influential films."
"For her first feature after graduating from the All-Russian State Institute for Cinematography (VGIK), Larisa Shepitko trained her lens on the fascinating Russian character actress Maya Bulgakova, who gives a marvelous performance as a once heroic Russian fighter pilot now living a quiet, disappointingly ordinary life as a school principal. Subtly portraying one woman's desperation with elegant, spare camera work and casual, fluid storytelling, Shepitko, with Wings, announced herself as an important new voice in Soviet cinema."
"WINGS OF DESIRE is one of cinema’s loveliest city symphonies. Bruno Ganz is Damiel, an angel perched atop buildings high over Berlin who can hear the thoughts—fears, hopes, dreams—of all the people living below. But when he falls in love with a beautiful trapeze artist, he is willing to give up his immortality and come back to earth to be with her. Made not long before the fall of the Berlin wall, this stunning tapestry of sounds and images, shot in black and white and color by the legendary Henri Alekan, is movie poetry. And it forever made the name Wim Wenders synonymous with film art."
"“God, why hast thou forsaken me?” With WINTER LIGHT, Ingmar Bergman explores the search for redemption in a meaningless existence. Small-town pastor Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Björnstrand) performs his duties mechanically before a dwindling congregation, including his stubbornly devoted lover, Märta (Ingrid Thulin). When he is asked to assuage a troubled parishioner’s (Max von Sydow) debilitating fear of nuclear annihilation, Tomas is terrified to find that he can provide nothing but his own doubt. The beautifully photographed WINTER LIGHT is an unsettling look at the human craving for personal validation in a world seemingly abandoned by God."
"SUMMER EQUINOX, AUTUMNAL EQUINOX, and WINTER SOLSTICE, all of which appear in Straits of Magellan, make up Hollis Frampton’s film cycle SOLARIUMAGELANI (1974). In each film, Frampton included complementary color leader to represent what is missing from the season. For STRAITS OF MAGELLAN: WINTER SOLSTICE, he once referred to it as “the clear blue of the summer sky.”"
"In this acclaimed adaptation of the first novel by legendary Southern writer Flannery O’Connor, John Huston vividly brings to life her poetic world of American eccentricity. Brad Dourif, in an impassioned performance, is Hazel Motes, who, fresh out of the army, attempts to open the first Church Without Christ in the small town of Taulkinham. Populated with inspired performances that seem to spring right from O’Connor’s pages, Huston’s WISE BLOOD is an incisive portrait of spirituality and Evangelicalism, and a faithful, loving evocation of a writer’s vision."
"Stephen Cone established himself as one of American independent cinema’s most sensitive and perceptive voices with his critical breakthrough, a radiantly empathetic look at coming of age in the Bible Belt. Over the course of their final summer in Charleston, South Carolina, before college, gay teen Tim (Tyler Ross) and his best friends Laura (Allison Torem) and Brea (Molly Kunz) grapple with crises of faith, friendship, love, and sexuality as they find themselves questioning the fundamentalist Baptist beliefs of their families. Casting light on a segment of American society rarely depicted on-screen, Cone offers an illuminating perspective on the intersection of queer identity and modern religion."
A shape-shifting guru delivers an utterly bizarre lesson in enlightenment.
"When the man who seduced the famous painter Otoko as a teenager--and then wrote a bestselling novel about it--reappears in her life, her pupil--and lesbian lover--hatches a plot to destroy the man and his family."
"WITHIN OUR GATES is the earliest surviving feature film by an African American director. It was Oscar Micheaux’s second film (after 1919’s THE HOMESTEADER, now lost), centering on an idealistic young woman named Sylvia Landry (Evelyn Preer, one of the first great stars of the race film) who attempts to raise money for an elementary school for black children. In the course of navigating the racial politics of both the black and white communities, Sylvia’s past is revealed in a series of flashbacks that contain the film’s most notorious sequence: the lynching of her parents by a white mob. Micheaux’s staging of the scene is startling in its bluntness and speaks volumes about the director’s fearlessness and willingness to address taboo subject matter. The film touches upon other themes that would recur throughout the controversial filmmaker’s career, such as the promise of rural life vs. the corrupting influence of the city, and the use of religion as a means of misleading the black community."
"London. The 1960s. Two unemployed actors—acerbic, elegantly wasted Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and the anxiety-ridden “I” (Paul McGann)—drown their frustrations in booze, pills, and lighter fluid. When Withnail’s Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) offers his cottage, they escape the squalor of their flat for a week in the country. They soon realize they’ve gone on holiday by mistake when their wits—and friendship—are sorely tested by violent downpours, less than hospitable locals, and empty cupboards. An intelligent, superbly acted, and hilarious film, Bruce Robinson’s semi-autobiographical cult favorite is presented here in its complete and uncut version."
"From the crazed madman of the macabre Herschell Gordon Lewis comes his most fiendish feat of terrifying onscreen trickery yet—behold, THE WIZARD OF GORE! You’ve all seen the trick in which the magician saws his glamorous assistant in half—but what about the spike-through-the-brain gag? Or the good old smashing punch press? Montag the Magnificent’s blood-curdling onstage performances shock and dazzle his audiences in equal measure. But when his participants start winding up dead, local talk-show hostess Sherry Carson suspects that his gruesome “act” may be more sinister than it seems. Featuring some of the most notoriously gory set pieces in all of Lewis’s blood-soaked career, THE WIZARD OF GORE is a stomach-churning, Grand Guignol production that’s less sleight of hand and more slice of hand!"
"Toshiko (Mitsuko Mito) joins her criminal lover at a beach resort, where he tries to convince her to run away with him. With expressive technique and picturesque on-location shooting, director Keisuke Kinoshita stylishly captures a woman's struggle to free herself from her past."
It’s an unhappy birthday for a woman (Alison Pill) whose mental disintegration begins when she misplaces her phone.
Five different angles on a woman's personality and murder come to light during the police investigation in Anthony Asquith's murder mystery.
"One of the 1960s’ great international art-house sensations, WOMAN IN THE DUNES (SUNA NO ONNA) was for many the grand unveiling of the surreal, idiosyncratic world of Hiroshi Teshigahara. Eiji Okada plays an amateur entomologist who has left Tokyo to study an unclassified species of beetle found in a vast desert. When he misses his bus back to civilization, he is persuaded to spend the night with a young widow (Kyoko Kishida) in her hut at the bottom of a sand dune. What results is one of cinema’s most unnerving and palpably erotic battles of the sexes, as well as a nightmarish depiction of everyday life as a Sisyphean struggle—an achievement that garnered Teshigahara an Academy Award nomination for best director."
"Biwako is the sole witness to a grizzly murder. When she is convinced to play bait for the killer two cops are assigned to protect her, one who is a super-fan and the other who couldn't care who she is."
"A man and a woman living next door to each other become too neighborly, as an old flame reignites. Problem is they are now both married to other people. Past meets present and the heat becomes too much to handle."
"Charles Chaplin made his debut as a director/producer at United Artists with A WOMAN OF PARIS which, as a serious drama, was a major departure from his previous output. He proved that he was just as adept here as he was with comedy, however, presenting a sincerely mature story of the title character (Edna Purviance), who is betrayed and cast aside by her would-be fiance and ends up a ""kept"" woman in the company of the disreputable Adolphe Menjou."
A woman supporting her brother lies about the way she earns her money. Directed by Yasujir≈ç Ozu.
"Sometimes two faces are better than one. A disfigured woman with a criminal history receives a new lease on life via the wonders of plastic surgery, but her past scars continue to leave an impression."
"After World War II, Mizoguchi was inspired by Italian neorealism to make one of the most emotionally and visually raw films of his career. Filmed on location in Osaka, Women of the Night concerns two sisters, Fusako, a war widow, and Natsuko, having an affair with a narcotics smuggler, who along with their younger friend Kumiko descend into prostitution and moral chaos amid the postwar devastation surrounding them."
"Made for Italian television, this powerful documentary by iconoclastic auteur Liliana Cavani profiles a number of women who participated in the Italian Resistance and survived the German invasion of Italy during World War II. Cited by Cavani as the inspiration for her controversial international breakthrough THE NIGHT PORTER, WOMEN OF THE RESISTANCE is a both an inspiring ode to the courage of the everyday heroines who fought back against fascism and a harrowing exploration of the desperate extremes to which war drives all involved."
"Against the tumultuous backdrop of Iranʼs 1953 CIA-backed coup dʼétat, the destinies of four women converge in a beautiful orchard, where they find independence, solace and companionship. Acclaimed photographer Shirin Neshat makes her directorial debut with this incisive and sumptuously filmed reflection on the pivotal moment in history that directly led to the Islamic Revolution and the Iran we know today."
"Hailed by the New York Times on its Paris release as ""one of the great films in motion picture history"" Raymond Bernard's WOODEN CROSSES, France's answer to All Quiet on the Western Front, still stuns with its depiction of the travails of one French regiment during World War I. Using a masterful arsenal of film techniques, from haunting matte paintings to jarring documentary-like camerawork in the film's battle sequences, Bernard created a pacifist work of enormous empathy and chilling despair. No one who has ever seen this technical and emotional powerhouse has been able to forget it."
"Dorothy Arzner offers a snappily entertaining, socially perceptive look at female solidarity in this Depression-era tale of young women striving to succeed in their careers and in love. Newly arrived in Manhattan from Indiana, small-town sisters Mae and June Thorpe (Dorothy Hall and Judith Wood) take up residence in an all-women’s boardinghouse, then set about searching for jobs—which they find, along with a host of romantic complications. As directed by feminist trailblazer Arzner, WORKING GIRLS crackles with pre-Code innuendo and displays a nuanced understanding of the interplay between gender and economic mobility in 1930s America."
"Hollywood has had its fair share of power couples; husband and wife duos that have each enjoyed illustrious careers in the film industry. In France, one of the most noteworthy marital unions occurred when Jacques Demy and Agnès Varda tied the knot in 1962. Distinguished filmmakers in their own right, the couple enjoyed nearly 30 years together until Demy died in 1990. Following his death, Varda constructed a documentary paying tribute to the work of her husband and highlighting his place in the history of film."

"An at once intimate and expansive exploration of globalization from visionary director Jia Zhangke, THE WORLD takes place in the eponymous theme park on the outskirts of Beijing, where iconic monuments from the Eiffel Tower to the Taj Mahal are reproduced for tourists. It’s there that the park’s employees—including a dancer (Zhao Tao) and a security guard (Cheng Taishen)—drift together and are pulled apart in a cycle of connection and alienation that speaks eloquently to the effects of China’s rapid modernization."
"A teenage tomboy challenges the patriarchal code of her conservative Macedonian town when she dares to take part in a religious ritual traditionally reserved for men in this empowering exploration of gender, sexuality, and self-actualization."
The holidays take a surprising turn when an Irish priest accompanies his volatile nephew on a visit to his incarcerated boyfriend.
"What does the energy harnessed through orgasm have to do with the state of communist Yugoslavia circa 1971? Only counterculture filmmaker extraordinaire Dušan Makavejev has the answers (or the questions). His surreal documentary-fiction collision WR: MYSTERIES OF THE ORGANISM begins as an investigation into the life and work of controversial psychologist and philosopher Wilhelm Reich and then explodes into a free-form narrative of a beautiful young Slavic girl’s sexual liberation. Banned upon its release in the director’s homeland, the art-house smash WR is both whimsical and bold in its blending of politics and sexuality."
"With depth and style, Wim Wenders updates a late-eighteenth-century novel by Goethe, transposing it to 1970s West Germany and giving us the story of an aimless writer (Rüdiger Vogler) who leaves his hometown to find himself and winds up befriending a group of other travelers. Seeking inspiration to help him escape his creative funk, he instead discovers the limits of attempts to refashion one's identity. One of the director's least seen but earthiest and most devastating soul searches, WRONG MOVES features standout supporting performances from New German Cinema regulars Hanna Schygulla and Peter Kern and, in her first film appearance, Nastassja Kinski."
"When a crew of scientists returns from Mars with a sample of the space spores that contaminated their ship, they inadvertently bring about a nightmarish earth invasion. After one of the spores is analyzed in a lab, it escapes, eventually growing into an enormous, rampaging beaked beast. An intergalactic monster movie from longtime Shochiku stable director Kazui Nihonmatsu, The X from Outer Space was the first in the studio's short but memorable cycle of horror pictures."
Agnès Varda’s lifelong interest in still portraiture informs this record of a provocative Munich exhibition by the artist Ydessa Hendeles that contemplates our need for nostalgia and comfort in a violent world through an assemblage of hundreds of antique photographs of people and their teddy bears.
A man is hired to compile the definitive history of human existence before the planet blows up.
"Mikio Naruse's Yearning (1964) is a story of an extended family tragedy growing out of the Second World War. Hideko Takamine stars as a young widow whose husband is killed in the war, and her business all-but-wiped out in a bombing raid -- in his memory she keeps the business going, only to encounter interference and attempts at theft by her sisters-in-law, and the unwanted attention of her brother-in-law. It's all a tragedy-in-the-making, presented with uniformly powerful performances led by Takamine. Sharp-eyed viewers can also spot Mie Hama, from the James Bond movie You Only Live Twice, in a small supporting role."
"Indonesia, 1965. Revolution is in the air. Foreign journalists covering the unrest are kept at arm’s length by the wary Sukarno government. With the help of local Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt) and diplomat Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver), naive Australian reporter Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson) suddenly rockets to importance as a newsman with access to inside information about the coming coup d’état. But Hamilton must make a choice: to succeed as a newsman—to report this story to the world—he must betray, and possibly destroy, the two people who love him. Hunt won an Academy Award for her audacious cross-gender performance as Kwan, though the film is marred by the decision to cast her, a white actor, as a Chinese Australian character."
"The extraordinary, internationally embraced YI YI (A ONE AND A TWO . . .), directed by the late Taiwanese master Edward Yang, follows a middle-class family in Taipei over the course of one year, beginning with a wedding and ending with a funeral. Whether chronicling middle-age father NJ’s tentative flirtations with an old flame or precocious young son Yang-Yang’s attempts at capturing reality with his beloved camera, the filmmaker deftly imbues every gorgeous frame with a compassionate clarity. Warm, sprawling, and dazzling, this intimate epic is one of the undisputed masterworks of the new century."
"The incomparable Toshiro Mifune stars in Akira Kurosawa’s visually stunning and darkly comic YOJIMBO. To rid a terror-stricken village of corruption, wily masterless samurai Sanjuro turns a range war between two evil clans to his own advantage. Remade twice, by Sergio Leone and Walter Hill, this exhilarating genre-twister remains one of the most influential and entertaining films of all time."
"A legendary, once-lost landmark of American underground cinema, Sara Driver’s first film was rediscovered in 2008 and has since taken its place as one of the key works of the No Wave filmmaking movement. Based on a story by Paul Bowles, YOU ARE NOT I takes the form of a fugue-state trance as it follows the journey of a disturbed woman (Suzanne Fletcher) who has escaped from an asylum and whose fractured mental state is reflected in the very form of the film."
"With an innovative mix of archival footage, reenactments, and voice-over, director Marie-Elsa Sgualdo tells the story of her mother’s life and how it flows into her own, arriving at an intimate reflection on the origins of the feminist movement."
"Winner of the best director award at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the latest social-realist triumph from Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne finds the pair applying their patented brand of heartrendingly empathetic humanism to an explosive subject. Under the sway of his radical imam, Ahmed (Idir Ben Addi, in a revelatory debut performance), a thirteen-year-old Muslim boy growing up in a small Belgian town, becomes increasingly enamored with the tenets of violent religious extremism—a rejection of his family and society that has shocking consequences. Resisting both easy answers and the urge to sensationalize, the Dardenne brothers offer a clear-eyed, grippingly naturalistic portrait of a young life in crisis graced with the expansive compassion that has made them among the most consistently lauded cinematic voices of our time."
"In Alfred Hitchcock's tale of a wrongly accused man, a man must prove his innocence with the chief constable's daughter as his only help."
"Jacques Demy followed up THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG with another musical about missed connections and second chances, this one a more effervescent confection. Twins Delphine and Solange, a dance instructor and a music teacher (played by real-life sisters Catherine Deneuve and Françoise Dorléac), long for big-city life; when a fair comes through their quiet port town, so does the possibility of escape. With its jazzy Michel Legrand score, pastel paradise of costumes, and divine supporting cast (George Chakiris, Grover Dale, Danielle Darrieux, Michel Piccoli, and Gene Kelly), THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT is a tribute to Hollywood optimism from sixties French cinema’s preeminent dreamer."
"For this documentary about the making of THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT, filmmaker Agnès Varda, director Jacques Demy’s widow, returned to the town of Rochefort for the film’s twenty-fifth anniversary. In it, she interviews actors Catherine Deneuve, Jacques Perrin, and George Chakiris, as well as townspeople who were present during the filming."
"The first film Jackie Chan made at Golden Harvest—the studio where he would go on to make many of his greatest films—was a record-breaking box-office smash that firmly established him as Hong Kong’s leading kung-fu superstar. In his second outing as director, Chan plays Dragon Lung, a martial-arts student who sets out to find his errant brother who has defected to a rival school, only to get mixed up in a case of mistaken identity from which he must fight his way out. It all builds to an epic, nearly twenty-minute final battle that sees Chan balancing slapstick and thrilling action with rip-roaring virtuosity."
"A young couple on the run encounter car trouble - right outside a dancehall teeming with outlaws. The two go through a slapstick struggle to keep the crooks, and the girlfriend's angry father, at bay."
A newpaper reporter investigates the lives of juvenile delinquents. Directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.
"At an Austrian boys’ boarding school in the early 1900s, shy, intelligent Törless observes the sadistic behavior of his fellow students, doing nothing to help a victimized classmate—until the torture goes too far. Adapted from Robert Musil’s acclaimed novel, YOUNG TÖRLESS launched the New German Cinema movement and garnered the 1966 Cannes Film Festival International Critics’ Prize for first-time director Volker Schlöndorff."
"Carlos Cuarón wrote and directed this twelve-minute short in 2002, taking a look at family secrets hidden behind closed doors."
"A man’s head undergoes all sorts of bizarre contortions and transformations as he sings an original love ballad in Bill Plympton’s Oscar-nominated breakout short, which introduced many to his surreally twisted world."
"Chris Shepherd directs a short animation in tribute to Joe Orton (Entertaining Mr Sloane, Loot) to mark the 50th anniversary of his death. Joe Orton would write letters of complaint using the pseudonym of Edna Welthorpe. Using this persona, Orton would wind up companies, vicars and even ridicule his own plays. In this short we see what mayhem ensues when Edna writes to Smedley Jams and Littlewood home catalogue service."
This short was made by SMITHEREENS director Susan Seidelman when she was a film student at New York University in 1979.
An alienated young man flirts with extremism during a major student protest. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda.
"When a mysterious stranger muscles into two rival yakuza gangs, Tokyo’s underworld explodes with violence. YOUTH OF THE BEAST (YAJU NO SEISHUN) was a breakthrough for director Seijun Suzuki, introducing the flamboyant colors, hallucinatory images, and striking compositions that would become his trademark. The Criterion Collection proudly presents the film that revitalized the yakuza genre and helped define the inimitable style of a legendary cinematic renegade."
"This film, like Leni Riefenstahl's infamous OLYMPIA, was produced by Adolf Hitler's Reichsfilmkammer. YOUTH OF THE WORLD, a celebration of the 1936 Winter Games, may forgo narration, but its visuals throb with kinetic energy and visual poetry."
"Returning to his hometown, an old man reminisces about the unrequited love he felt towards his cousin during their youth. Keisuke Kinoshita directs."
"This elaborately conceived and brilliantly mounted comedy is Pierre Etaix’s most beloved movie, as well as his personal favorite. Beginning as a clever homage to silent film, complete with intertitles, YOYO blossoms into a poignant family saga (in which Etaix plays both a father and his grown son) and a celebration of the circus Etaix adored. Chock-full of nimble sight gags and ingenious sound effects, YOYO is very sweet, a little bit melancholy, and wholly imaginative."
"This smash road comedy from Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuarón is that rare movie to combine raunchy subject matter and emotional warmth. Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna shot to international stardom as a pair of horny Mexico City teenagers from different classes who, after their girlfriends jet off to Italy for the summer, are bewitched by a gorgeous older Spanish woman (Maribel Verdú) they meet at a wedding. When she agrees to accompany them on a trip to a faraway beach, the three form an increasingly intense and sensual alliance that ultimately strips them both physically and emotionally bare. Shot with elegance and dexterity by the great Emmanuel Lubezki, Y TU MAMÁ TAMBIÉN is a funny and moving look at human desire."
"Yudie, an elderly Lower East Side lifer, looks back at a life lived on her own terms."
Exploration of cajun cooking and culture.
"A pulse-pounding political thriller, Greek expatriate director Costa-Gavras’s Z was one of the cinematic sensations of the late sixties, and remains among the most vital dispatches from that hallowed era of filmmaking. This Academy Award winner—loosely based on the 1963 assassination of Greek left-wing activist Gregoris Lambrakis—stars Yves Montand as a prominent politician and doctor whose public murder amid a violent demonstration is covered up by military and government officials; Jean-Louis Trintignant is the tenacious magistrate who’s determined not to let them get away with it. Featuring kinetic, rhythmic editing, Raoul Coutard’s expressive vérité photography, and Mikis Theodorakis’s unforgettable, propulsive score, Z is a technically audacious and emotionally gripping masterpiece."
"Lucrecia Martel’s daring adaptation of the classic Argentine novel by Antonio di Benedetto is a brilliantly subversive tragicomedy in which Zama (Daniel Giménez Cacho), an officer of the Spanish Crown stationed in South America, waits for a letter from the king granting him a transfer from the town where he is stagnating to a better place. As the years wear on without word from his superiors, Zama’s tropical torpor assumes increasingly absurd, dreamlike dimensions that speak to the inherent waste and futility of colonialism."
"A brash and precocious ten-year-old (Catherine Demongeot) comes to Paris for a whirlwind weekend with her rakish uncle (Philippe Noiret); he and the viewer get more than they bargained for, however, in this anarchic comedy from Louis Malle, which rides roughshod over the City of Light. Based on a popular novel by Raymond Queneau that had been considered unadaptable, Malle’s audacious ZAZIE DANS LE MÉTRO, made with flair on the cusp of the French New Wave, is a bit of stream-of-consciousness slapstick, wall-to-wall with visual gags, editing tricks, and effects."
"So effervescent and charming that one can easily forget its importance in film history, Jean Vigo’s enormously influential portrait of prankish boarding-school students is one of cinema’s great acts of rebellion. Based on the director’s own experiences as a youth, ZÉRO DE CONDUITE presents childhood as a time of unfettered imagination and brazen rule-flouting. It’s a sweet-natured vision of sabotage made vivid by dynamic visual experiments—including the famous, blissful slow-motion pillow fight."
"After Teiko's new husband disappears on a business trip, she discovers a pair of mysterious postcards hidden away in a book that may be clues to his fate."
"Iconoclastic auteur Bertrand Bonello blends voodoo, postcolonial tensions, and the spirit of Jacques Tourneur and Val Lewton to create a shivery, hypnotic excursion into heady horror. Haiti, 1962: a man (Mackenson Bijou) is brought back from the dead only to be sent to the living hell of the sugarcane fields. Fifty-five years later in Paris, at a prestigious all-girls boarding school, Melissa (Wislanda Louimat), a young Haitian teenager, confesses an old family secret to a group of new friends—never imagining that this strange tale will convince a heartbroken classmate to do the unthinkable. Displaying the same audaciousness he did in Saint Laurent and Nocturama, Bonello shifts seamlessly between eras, weaving a spellbinding vision of the ways in which colonialism’s legacy continues to haunt the present."
"While a student of anthropologist Franz Boas at Columbia University, Zora Neale Hurston embarked on a journey through Alabama and Florida, using a 16 mm camera to capture life among the rural African American communities she found there. Hurston would later become a renowned author, best remembered for her 1937 novel THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD."
"This silent 1972 short by Kevin Fernan features many key EQUINOX talents, including writer Mark McGee, ­effects technician Jim Danforth (in a cameo), and effects animator David Allen. It was shot in Los Angeles’s Bronson Canyon, which also served as a location for EQUINOX."
"This sixty-minute film was the first feature-length avant-garde work ever screened at the New York Film Festival, where it premiered in 1970."
